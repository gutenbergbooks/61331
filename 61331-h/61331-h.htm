</div>

<h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER I. <br /> GROWTH OF THE KINGLY POWER.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The object of the First Book was generally to
give a clear view of the principles upon which the
original settlement of the Anglosaxons was founded.
But as our earliest fortunes are involved in an obscurity
caused by the almost total absence of contemporary
records, and as the principles themselves
are not historically developed in all their integrity,
at least in this country, many conclusions could
only be arrived at through a system of induction,
by comparing the known facts of Teutonic history
in other lands, or at earlier periods, by tracing the
remnants of old institutions in their influence upon
society in an altered, and perhaps somewhat deteriorated,
condition, and lastly by general reasoning
derived from the nature of society itself. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Second Book is however devoted to the historical
development of those principles, in periods whereof
we possess more sufficient record, and to an investigation
of the form in which, after a long series
of compromises, our institutions slowly and gradually
unfolded themselves, till the close of the
Anglosaxon monarchy. The two points upon which
this part of the subject more particularly turns,
are, the introduction of Christianity, and the progressive
consolidation and extension of the kingly
power; and round these two points the chapters of
this Book will naturally group themselves. It is
fortunate for us that the large amount of historical
materials which we possess, enables us to follow the
various social changes in considerable detail, and
renders it possible to let the Anglosaxons tell their
own story to a much greater extent than in the first
Book.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the course of years, continual wars had removed
a multitude of petty kings or chieftains from
the scene; a consolidation of countries had taken
place; actual sovereignty, grounded on the law of
force, on possession, or on federal compacts, had
raised a few of the old dynasts above the rank of
their fellows; the other nobles, and families of royal
lineage, had for the most part submitted to the law
of the comitatus, swelling the ranks, adorning the
court, and increasing the power of princes who
had risen upon their degradation; and at the commencement
of the seventh century, England presented
the extraordinary spectacle of at least eight
independent kingdoms, of greater or less power and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>influence, and, as we may reasonably believe, very
various degrees of civil and moral cultivation. In
the extreme south-eastern corner of the island was
the Kentish confederation, comprising in all probability
the present counties of Kent, Essex, Middlesex,
Surrey, and Sussex, whose numerous kings acknowledged
the supremacy of Æðelberht, the son
of Eormanríc, a prince of the house of Æscings,
originally perhaps a Sussex family, but who claimed
their royal descent from Wóden, through Hengist,
the first traditional king of Kent. Under this head
three of the eight named kingdoms were thus
united; but successful warlike enterprise or the
praise of superior wisdom had extended the political
influence of the Æscing even to the southern bank
of the Humber. Next to Sussex, along the southern
coast, and as far westward as the border of the
Welsh in Dorsetshire or Devon, lay the kingdom
of the Westsaxons or Gewissas, which stretched
northward to the Thames and westward to the Severn,
and probably extended along the latter river
over at least a part of Gloucestershire: this kingdom,
or rather confederation, comprised all or part
of the following counties; Hampshire with the Isle
of Wight, a tributary sovereignty; Dorsetshire,
perhaps a part of Devonshire, Wiltshire, Berkshire,
a portion of Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and
Middlesex, up to the Chiltern Hills. Eastanglia
occupied the extreme east of the island, stretching
to the north and west up to the Wash and the
marshes of Lincoln and Cambridgeshire, and comprehending,
together with its marches, Norfolk and
Suffolk, and part at least of Cambridge, Huntingdon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. Mercia with
its dependent sovereignties occupied nearly all the
remaining portion of England east of the Severn
and south of the Humber, including a portion of
Herefordshire, and probably also of Salop, beyond
the western bank of the former river: while two
small kingdoms, often united into one, but when
separate, called Deira and Bernicia, filled the remaining
space from the Humber to the Pictish
border, which may be represented by a line running
irregularly north-east from Dumbarton to Inverkeithing<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
In the extreme west the remains of
the Keltic populations who had disdained to place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>themselves under the yoke of the Saxons, still maintained
a dangerous and often threatening independence:
and Cornwall and Devon, North and South
Wales, Cheshire, Lancashire, Cumberland, perhaps
even part of Northumberland, still formed important
fortresses, garrisoned by this hardy and unsubjugated
race. Beyond the Picts, throughout the
north of Scotland, and in the neighbouring island
of Ireland, were the Scots, a Keltic race, but not
so nearly allied as the Cornish, Cymric and Pictish
tribes.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is probable enough that the princes who presided
over these several aggregations of communities,
had their traditional or family alliances and
friendships, as well as their enmities, political and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>personal, and that some description of public law
may consequently have grown up among them, by
which their national intercourse was regulated. But
we cannot suppose this to have been either very
comprehensive or well defined. Least of all can
we find any proof that there was a community of
action among them, of a systematic and permanent
character. A national priesthood, and a central
service in which all alike participated, had
any such existed, might have formed a point of
union for all the races; but there is no record
of this, and, I think, but little probability of its
having been found at any time. If we consider the
various sources from which the separate populations
were derived, and the very different periods
at which they became masters of their several
seats; their constant hostility and the differences of
language<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and law; above all the distance of their
settlements, severed by deep and gloomy forests,
rude hills, unforded streams, or noxious and pestilential
morasses, we can hardly imagine any concert
among them for the establishment of a common
worship; it is even doubtful—so meagre are our
notices of the national heathendom—whether the
same gods were revered all over England; although
the descent of all the reigning families from Wóden
would seem to speak for his worship at least having
been universal. Again, there is reason to doubt
that the priesthood occupied here quite so commanding
a position as they may have enjoyed upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the continent, partly because the carelessness or
hatred of the British Christians refused to attempt
the conversion of their adversaries<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a>, and thus afforded
no opportunity for a reaction or combined
effort at resistance on the part of the Pagans; and
partly because we cannot look for any very deep
rooted religious convictions in the breast of the
wandering, military adventurer, removed from the
time-hallowed sites of ancient, local worship, and
strongly tempted to “trow upon himself,” in preference
to gods whose powers and attributes he had
little leisure to contemplate. The words of Coifi,
a Northumbrian high-priest, to Eádwini, do at any
rate imply a feeling on his part, that his position
was not so brilliant and advantageous as he thought
himself entitled to expect; and the very expressions
he uses, implying a very considerable degree
of subordination to the king of one principality<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a>,
are hardly consistent with the hypothesis of a national
hierarchy, which must have assumed a position
scarcely inferior to that of the sovereigns themselves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Finally, I cannot believe that, had such an
organization and such a body existed, there would
be no trace of the opposition it must have offered
to the introduction of the new creed: some record
there must have been of a triumph so signal as that
of Christianity under such circumstances; and the
good believers who lavish miracles upon most inadequate
occasions, must have given us some well-authenticated
cases by which the sanctity of the
monk was demonstrated to the confusion of the
pagan. The silence of the Christian historian is an
eloquent evidence of the insignificant power of the
heathen priesthood.</p>

<p class='c001'>Much less can we admit that there was any central
political authority, recognized, systematic and
regulated, by which the several kingdoms were
combined into a corporate body. There is indeed
a theory, respectable for its antiquity, and reproduced
by modern ingenuity, according to which
this important fact is assumed, and we are not only
taught that the several kingdoms formed a confederation,
at whose head, by election or otherwise,
one of the princes was placed with imperial power,
but that this institution was derived by direct imitation
from the custom of the Roman empire: we
further learn that the title of this high functionary
was Bretwalda, or Emperor of Britain, and that he
possessed the imperial decorations of the Roman
state<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a>. When this discovery was first made I know
not, but the most detailed account that I have seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>may be given from the, in many respects, excellent
and neglected work of Rapin. He tells us<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a>:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Saxons, Jutes, and Angles, that conquered
the best part of Britain, looking upon themselves
as one and the same people<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a>, as they had been in
Germany, established a form of government, as like
as possible to what they had lived under in their
own country. They formed their Wittena-Gemot,
or assembly of wise men, to settle the common
affairs of the seven kingdoms, and conferred the
command of their armies upon one chosen out of
the seven kings, to whom, for that reason no
doubt, some have given the title of Monarch, on
pretence of his having the precedence and some
superiority over the rest. But to me that dignity
seems rather to have been like that of Stadtholder
of the United Provinces of the Low Countries.
There was however some difference between the
Saxon government in Britain and that in Germany.
For instance, in Germany the governor of each
province entirely depended on the General Assembly,
where the supreme power was lodged; whereas
in Britain, each king was sovereign in his own dominions.
But notwithstanding this, all the kingdoms
together were, in some respects, considered
as the same state, and every one submitted to the
resolutions of the General Assembly of the Seven
Kingdoms, to which he gave his consent by himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>or representative.... A free election, and sometimes
force, gave the Heptarchy a chief or monarch,
whose authority was more or less, according to their
strength<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a>. For though the person invested with
this office had no right to an unlimited authority,
there was scarce one of these monarchs but what
aspired to an absolute power.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This description has at least the advantage of
detail and of consistency, even though it should unfortunately
lack that of truth; but most of those
who in more modern times have adopted the hypothesis,
refrain from giving us any explanation of
the fact it assumes: they tell us indeed the title,
and profess to name those who successively bore
it, but they are totally silent as to the powers of
this great public officer, as to the mode of his appointment,
the manner in which he exerted his authority,
or the object for which such authority was
found necessary. I must frankly confess that I am
unable to find any evidence whatever in favour of
this view, which appears to me totally inconsistent
with everything which we know of the state and
principles of society at the early period with which
we have to deal. In point of fact, everything depends
upon the way in which we construe a passage
of Beda, together with one in the Saxon
Chronicle, borrowed from him, and the meaning
which history and philology justify us in giving to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the words made use of by both authors. As the
question is of some importance, it may as well be
disposed of at once, although only two so-called
Bretwaldas are recorded previous to the seventh
century.</p>

<p class='c001'>Modern ingenuity, having hastily acquiesced in
the existence of this authority, has naturally been
somewhat at a loss to account for it; yet this is
obviously the most important part of the problem:
accordingly Mr. Sharon Turner looks upon the
Bretwalda as a kind of war-king, a temporary military
leader: he says<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a>,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The disaster of Ceawlin gave safety to Kent.
Ethelbert preserved his authority in that kingdom,
and at length proceeded to that insulary predominance
among the Anglosaxon kings, which they
called the Bretwalda, or the ruler of Britain.
Whether this was a mere title assumed by Hengist,
and afterwards by Ella, and continued by the most
successful Anglosaxon prince of his day, or conceded
in any national council of all the Anglosaxons,
or ambitiously assumed by the Saxon king
that most felt and pressed his temporary power,—whether
it was an imitation of the British unbennaeth,
or a continuation of the Saxon custom of
electing a war-cyning, cannot now be ascertained.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To this he adds in a note:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The proper force of this word Bretwalda cannot
imply conquest, because Ella the First is not said
to have conquered Hengist or Cerdic; nor did the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>other Bretwaldas conquer the other Saxon kingdoms.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Again he returns to the charge: in the eighth
chapter of the same book, he says<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a>:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps the conjecture on this dignity which
would come nearest the truth, would be, that it
was the Walda or ruler of the Saxon kingdoms
against the Britons, while the latter maintained the
struggle for the possession of the country,—a species
of Agamemnon against the general enemy, not
a title of dignity or power against each other. If
so, it would be but the war-king of the Saxons in
Britain, against its native chiefs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lappenberg, adopting this last view, refines upon
it in detail: he believes the Bretwalda to have
been the elected generalissimo of the Saxons against
the Welsh or other Keltic races, and that as the
tide of conquest rolled onwards, the dignity shifted
to the shoulders of that prince whose position made
him the best guardian of the frontiers. But this
will scarcely account to us for the Bretwaldadom
of Ælle in Sussex, Æðelberht in Kent, or Rǽdwald
in Eastanglia; yet these are three especially
named. Besides we have a right to require some
evidence that there ever was a common action of
the Saxons against the Britons, and that they
really were in the habit of appointing war-kings in
England, two points on which there exists not a
tittle of proof. Indeed it seems clear to me that a
piece of vicious philology lurks at the bottom of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>this whole theory, and that it rests entirely upon
the supposition that <em>Bret</em>walda means Ruler of the
<em>Britons</em>, which is entirely erroneous. Yet one would
think that on this point there ought to have been
no doubt for even a moment, and that it hardly
required for its refutation the philological demonstration
which will be given. Let us ask by whom
was the name used or applied? By the Saxons:
but surely the Saxons could never mean to designate
themselves by the name <em>Bret</em>, Britain; nor on
the other hand could a general against the Britons
be properly called their <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wealda</i></span> or king, the relation
expressed by the word <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wealda</i></span> being that of sovereignty
over subjects, not opposition to enemies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, if this British theory were at all sound,
how could we account for the title being so rarely
given to the kings of Wessex, and never to those
of Mercia, both of whom were nevertheless in continual
hostile contact with the Welsh, and of whom
the former at least exercised sovereign rights over
a numerous Welsh population dispersed throughout
their dominions? Again, why should it have
been given to successive kings of Northumberland,
whose contact with the British aborigines, even as
Picts, was not of any long continuance or great
moment<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a>? Above all, why should it not have been
given to Æðelfríð, who as Beda tells us was the
most severe scourge the Kelts had ever met with<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a>?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>But there are other serious difficulties arising from
the nature of the military force which, on any one
of the suppositions we are considering, must have
been placed at this war-king’s disposal: is it, for
example, conceivable, that people whose military
duty did not extend beyond the defence of their
own frontiers, and who even then could only be
brought into the field under the conduct of their
own shire-officers, would have marched away from
home, under a foreign king, to form part of a mixed
army? still more, that the comites of various
princes, whose bond and duty were of the most
strictly personal character, could have been mustered
under the banner of a stranger<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a>? Yet all
this must be assumed to have been usual and easy,
if we admit the received opinions as to the Bretwalda.
We should also be entitled to ask how it
happened that Wulfhere, Æðelbald, Offa, Cénwulf,
the preeminently military kings of the Mercians,
should have refrained from the use of a title
so properly belonging to their preponderating power
in England, and so useful in giving a legal and
privileged authority to the measures of permanent
aggrandizement which their resources enabled them
to take?</p>

<p class='c001'>Another supposition, that this dignity was in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>some way connected with the ecclesiastical establishment,
the foundation of new bishoprics<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a> or the
presidency of the national synods, seems equally
untenable; for in the first place there were Bretwaldas
before the introduction of Christianity; and
the intervention of particular princes in the foundation
of sees, without the limits of their own dominions,
may be explained without having recourse
to any such hypothesis; again, the Church never
agreed to any unity till the close of the seventh
century under Theodore of Tarsus; and lastly the
presidency of the synods, which were generally
held in Mercia<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a>, was almost exclusively in the
hands of the Mercian princes, till the Danes put
an end to their kingdom, and yet those princes
never bore the title at all. In point of fact, there
was no such special title or special office, and the
whole theory is constructed upon an insufficient
and untenable basis.</p>

<p class='c001'>It will be readily admitted that the fancies of the
Norman chroniclers may at once be passed over
unnoticed; they are worth no more than the still
later doctrines of Rapin and others, and rest upon
nothing but their explanation of passages which
we are equally at liberty to examine and test for
ourselves: I mean the passages already alluded to
from Beda and the Saxon Chronicle. Let us see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>then what Beda says upon this subject. He speaks
thus of Æðelberht<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a>:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“In the year of our Lord’s incarnation six hundred
and sixteen, which is the twenty-first from
that wherein Augustine and his comrades were
despatched to preach unto the race of the Angles,
Æðelberht, the king of the men of Kent, after a
temporal reign which he had held most gloriously
for six and fifty years, entered the eternal joys of
the heavenly kingdom: who was indeed but the
third among the kings of the Angle race who ruled
over all the southern provinces, which are separated
from those of the north by the river Humber
and its contiguous boundaries; but the first of all
who ascended to the kingdom of heaven. For the
first of all who obtained this empire was Ælli, king
of the Southsaxons: the second was Caelin, king
of the Westsaxons, who in their tongue was called
Ceaulin: the third, as I have said, was Æðilberht,
king of the men of Kent: the fourth was Redwald,
king of the Eastanglians, who even during the life
of Æðilberht, obtained predominance for his nation:
the fifth, Aeduini, king of the race of Northumbrians,
that is, the race which inhabits the
northern district of the river Humber, presided
with greater power over all the populations which
dwell in Britain, Britons and Angles alike, save
only the men of Kent; he also subdued to the empire
of the Angles, the Mevanian isles, which lie between
Ireland and Britain: the sixth Oswald, himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>that most Christian king of the Northumbrians,
had rule with the same boundaries: the seventh
Osuiu, his brother, having for some time governed
his kingdom within nearly the same boundaries, for
the most part subdued or reduced to a tributary
condition the nations also of the Picts and Scots,
who occupy the northern ends of Britain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Certainly, it must be admitted that the exception
of the Men of Kent, in the case of Eádwini,
is a serious blow to the Bretwalda theory. I have
used the word <em>predominance</em>, to express the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ducatus</i></span>
or <em>leadership</em>, of Beda, and it is clear that such a
leadership is what he means to convey. But in all
the cases which he has cited, it is equally clear
from every part of his book, that the fact was a
merely accidental one, fully explained by the peculiar
circumstances in every instance: it is invariably
connected with conquest, and preponderant
military power: a successful battle either against
Kelt or Saxon, by removing a dangerous neighbour
or dissolving a threatening confederacy, placed
greater means at the disposal of any one prince
than could be turned against him by any other or
combination of others; and he naturally assumed
a right to dictate to them, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>iure belli</i></span>, in all transactions
where he chose to consider his own interests
concerned. But all the facts in every case show
that there was no concert, no regular dignity, and
no regular means of obtaining it; that it was a
mere fluctuating superiority, such as we may find
in Owhyhee, Tahiti, or New Zealand, due to success
in war, and lost in turn by defeat. On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>rout of Ceawlin, the second Bretwalda, by the
Welsh, we learn that he was expelled from the
throne, and succeeded by Ceólwulf, who spent many
years in struggles against Angles, Welsh, Scots and
Picts<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a>: according to Turner’s and Lappenberg’s
theory, he was the very man to have been made
Bretwalda; but we do not find this to have been
the case, or that the dignity returned to the intervening
Sussex; but Æðelberht of Kent, whose ambition
had years before led him to measure his
force against Ceawlin’s, stepped into the vacant
monarchy. The truth is that Æðelberht, who had
husbanded his resources, and was of all the Saxon
kings the least exposed to danger from the Keltic
populations, was enabled to impose his authority
upon his brother kings, and to make his own terms:
and in a similar way, at a later period, it is clear
that Rædwald of Eastanglia was enabled to deprive
him of it. I therefore again conclude that this so-called
Bretwaldadom was a mere accidental predominance;
there is no peculiar function, duty or
privilege anywhere mentioned as appertaining to
it; and when Beda describes Eádwini of Northumberland
proceeding with the Roman <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>tufa</em></span> or banner
before him, as an ensign of dignity, he does so
in terms which show that it was not, as Palgrave
seems to imagine, an ensign of imperial authority
used by all Bretwaldas, but a peculiar and remarkable
affectation of that particular prince. Before
I leave this word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ducatus</i></span>, I may call attention to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the fact that Ecgberht, whom the Saxon Chronicle
adds to the list given by Beda, has left some charters
in which he also uses it<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a>, and that they are
the only charters in which it does occur. From
these it appears that he dated his reign ten years
earlier than his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ducatus</i></span>, that is, that he was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rex</i></span> in
802, but not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dux</i></span> till 812. Now it is especially observable
that in 812 he had not yet commenced
that career of successful aggression against the
other Saxon kingdoms, which justified the Chronicler
in numbering him among those whom Camden
and Rapin call the Monarchs, and Palgrave the Emperors
of Britain. He did not attack Mercia and
subdue Kent till 825: in the same year he formed
his alliance with Eastanglia: only in 820 did he
ruin the power of Mercia, and receive the submission
of the Northumbrians. But in the year 812
he did move an army against the Welsh, and remained
for several months engaged in military operations
within their frontier: there is every reason
then to think that the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ducatus</i></span> of Ecgberht is only
a record of those conquests over his British neighbours,
which enabled him to turn his hand with
such complete success against his Anglosaxon
rivals; and thus that it has no reference to the expression
used by Beda to express the factitious preponderance
of one king over another. Let us now
inquire to what the passage in the Saxon Chronicle
amounts, which has put so many of our historians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>upon a wrong track, by supplying them with the
suspicious name Bretwalda. Speaking of Ecgberht
the Chronicler says<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a>, “And the same year king
Ecgberht overran the kingdom of the Mercians,
and all that was south of the Humber; and he was
the eighth king who was Bretwalda.” And then,
after naming the seven mentioned by Beda, and
totally omitting all notice of the Mercian kings,
he concludes,—“the eighth was Ecgberht, king of
the Westsaxons.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Now it is somewhat remarkable that of six manuscripts
in which this passage occurs, one only
reads Bretwalda: of the remaining five, four have
Bryten-walda or-wealda, and one Breten-anweald,
which is precisely synonymous with Brytenwealda.
All the rules of orderly criticism would therefore
compel us to look upon this as the right reading,
and we are confirmed in so doing by finding that
Æðelstán in one of his charters<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> calls himself also
“<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Brytenwealda ealles ðyses ealondes,</span>”—ruler or
monarch of all this island. Now the true meaning
of this word, which is compounded of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wealda</i></span>, a
ruler, and the adjective <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>bryten</i></span>, is totally unconnected
with Bret or Bretwealh, the name of the
British aborigines, the resemblance to which is
merely accidental: <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>bryten</i></span> is derived from <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>breótan</i></span>,
to distribute, to divide, to break into small portions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>to disperse: it is a common prefix to words denoting
wide or general dispersion<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a>, and when coupled with
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wealda</i></span> means no more than an extensive, powerful
king, a king whose power is widely extended. We
must therefore give up the most attractive and seducing
part of all this theory, the name, which rests
upon nothing but the passage in one manuscript of
the Chronicle,—and that, far from equal to the rest
in antiquity or correctness of language: and as for
anything beyond the name, I again repeat that we
are indebted for it to nothing but the ingenuity of
modern scholars, deceived by what they fancied the
name itself; that there is not the slightest evidence
of a king exercising a central authority, and very
little at any time, of a combined action among the
Saxons; and that it is quite as improbable that any
Saxon king should ever have had a federal army to
command, as it is certainly false that there ever
was a general <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena gemót</span> for him to preside over.
I must therefore in conclusion declare my disbelief
as well in a college of kings, as in an officer, elected
or otherwise appointed, whom they considered as
their head. The development of all the Anglosaxon
kingdoms was of far too independent and fortuitous
a character for us to assume any general concert
among them, especially as that independence is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>manifested upon those points particularly, where a
central and combined action would have been most
certain to show itself<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But although I cannot admit the growth of an
imperial power in any such way, I still believe the
royal authority to have been greatly consolidated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and thereby extended, before the close of the sixth
century. It is impossible, for a very long period,
to look upon the Anglosaxon kingdoms otherwise
than as camps, planted upon an enemy’s territory,
and not seldom in a state of mutual hostility. All
had either originated in, or had at some period
fallen into, a state of military organization, in which
the leaders are permitted to assume powers very
inconsistent with the steady advance of popular
liberty; and in the progress of their history, events
were continually recurring which favoured the permanent
establishment and consolidation of those
powers. Upon all their western and northern frontiers
lay ever-watchful and dangerous Keltic populations,
the co-operation of whose more inland
brethren was always to be dreaded, and whose attacks
were periodically renewed till very long after
the preponderance of one crown over the rest was
secured,—attacks only too often favoured by the
civil wars and internal struggles of the Germanic
conquerors. Upon all the eastern coasts hovered
swarms of daring adventurers, ready to put in practice
upon the Saxons themselves the frightful lesson
of piracy which these had given the Roman world
in the third and fourth centuries, and ever welcomed
by the Keltic inhabitants as the ministers
of their own vengeance. The constant state of
military preparation which was thus rendered necessary
could have no other result than that of
giving a vast preponderance to the warlike over
the peaceful institutions; of raising the practised
and well-armed comites to a station yearly more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and more important; of leading to the multiplication
of fortresses, with their royal castellans and
stationary garrisons; nay—by constantly placing
the freemen under martial law, and inuring them
to the urgencies of military command—of finally
breaking down the innate feeling and guarantees of
freedom, and even of materially ruining the cultivator,
all whose energy and all whose time were not
too much, if a comfortable subsistence was to be
wrung from the soil he owned. It is also necessary
to bear in mind the power derived from forcible
possession of lands from which the public enemy
had been expelled, and which, we may readily believe,
turned to the advantage, mostly if not exclusively,
of the king and his nobles. No wonder then
if at a very early period the Mark-organization,
which contained within itself the seeds of its own
decay, had begun to give way, and that a systematic
<em>commendation</em>, as it was called, to the adjacent lords
was beginning to take its place. To the operation
of these natural causes we must refer the indisputable
predominance established by a few superior
kings before the end of the sixth century, not only
over the numerous dynastic families which still remained
scattered over the face of the country, but
also over the free holders in the gá or scýr.</p>

<p class='c001'>To these however was added one of still greater
moment. The introduction of Christianity in a
settled form, which finally embraced the whole
Saxon portion of the island, dates from the commencement
of the seventh century. Though not
unknown to the various British tribes, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>long been in communication with their fellow-believers
of Gaul and, according to some authorities<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a>,
of Rome, it had made but little progress among the
German tribes, although a tendency to give it at
least a tolerant hearing had for some time been
making way among them<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a>. But in 595 Pope Gregory
the Great determined upon giving effect to his
scheme of a missionary expedition to Britain, which
he had long revolved, had at one time determined
to undertake in person, and had relinquished only
as far as his own journey was concerned, in consequence
of the opposition manifested by the inhabitants
of Rome to his quitting the city. Having
finally matured his plan, he selected a competent
number of monks and ecclesiastics, and despatched
them under the guidance of Augustine, with directions
to found an episcopal church among the
heathen Saxons. The progress and success of this
missionary effort must not be treated of here; suffice
it to say that, one by one, the Teutonic kingdoms
of the island accepted the new faith, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>before the close of the first century from the arrival
of Augustine, the whole of German England was
united into one church, under a Metropolitan, who
accidentally was also a missionary from Rome<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Strange would it have been had the maxims of
law or rules of policy which these men brought
with them, been different from those which prevailed
in the place from which they came. Roman
feelings, Roman views and modes of judging, the
traditions of the empire and the city, the legislation
of the emperors and the popes,—these were their
sources both of opinion and action. The predominance
of the kings must have appeared to them
natural and salutary; the subordination of all men
to their appointed rulers was even one of the doctrines
of Christianity itself, as taught by the great
apostle of the gentiles, and recommended by the
example of the Saviour. But the consolidation and
advancement of the royal authority, if they could
only form a secure alliance with it, could not but
favour their great object of spreading the Gospel
among populations otherwise dispersed and inaccessible:
hence it seems probable that all their
efforts would be directed to the end which circumstances
already favoured, and that the whole spiritual
and temporal influence of the clergy would
be thrown into the scale of monarchy. Moreover
the clergy supplied a new point of approach between
our own and foreign courts: to say nothing
of Rome, communication with which soon became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>close and frequent, very shortly after their establishment
here, we find an increased and increasing
intercourse between our kings and those of Gaul;
and this again offered an opportunity of becoming
familiar <a id='corr27.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='wtth'>with</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_27.5'><ins class='correction' title='wtth'>with</ins></a></span> the views and opinions which had
flowed, as it were, from the imperial city into the
richest and happiest of her provinces. The strict
Teutonic law of wergyld, they perhaps could not
prevail to change, and to the last, the king, like
every other man, continued to have his price; but
the power of the clergy is manifest even in the very
first article of Æðelberht’s law, and to it we in all
probability owe the ultimate affixing of the penalty
of death to the crime of high-treason,—a marvellous
departure from the ancient rule. Taking all
the facts of the case into account, we cannot but
believe that the introduction of Christianity, which
not only taught the necessity of obedience to lawful
authority, but accustomed men to a more central
and combined exercise of authority through the
very spectacle of the episcopal system itself, tended
in no slight degree to perpetuate the new order
which was gradually undermining and superseding
the old Mark-organization, and thus finally brought
England into the royal circle of European families<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The chapters of the present Book will be devoted
to an investigation of the institutions proper to
this altered condition, to the officers by whom the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>government of the country was conducted, from the
seventh to the eleventh centuries, and to the general
social relations which thus arose. If in the
course of our investigation it should appear that a
gradually diminishing share of freedom remained
to the people, yet must we bear in mind that the
old organization was one which could not keep pace
with the progress of human society, and that it was
becoming daily less suited to the ends for which it
first existed; that in this, as in all great changes,
a compromise necessarily took place, and mutual
sacrifices were required; after all, that we finally
retained a great amount of rational and orderly
liberty, full of the seeds of future development, and
gained many of the advantages of Roman cultivation,
without paying too high a price for them, in
the loss of our nationality.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. I allude more particularly to the introduction of Christianity, the
enactment of laws, the establishment of dioceses, and military measures
against the Britons. In two late publications, Mr. Hallam has
bestowed his attention upon the same subject, and with much the same
result. His acute and well-balanced mind seems to have been struck
by the historical difficulties which lie in the way of the Bretwalda
theory, though he does not attach so much force as I think we ought,
to its total inconsistency with the general social state of Anglosaxon
England in the sixth and seventh centuries, or as seems justly due to
the philological argument. He cites from Adamnan a passage in these
words: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">(Oswald) totius Britanniae imperator ordinatus a deo.</span>” But
these words only prove at the utmost that Adamnan attributed a certain
power to Oswald, connected in fact with conquest, and implying
anything but consent, election or appointment, by his fellow-kings.
And Mr. Hallam himself inclines to the belief that the title may have
been one given to Oswald by his own subjects, rather than the assertion
of a fact that he truly ruled over all Britain. He conceives that the
three Northumbrian kings, having been victorious in war and paramount
over the minor kingdoms, were really designated, at least among their
own subjects, by the name Bretwalda, or ruler of Britain, and “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">totius
Britanniae imperator,</span>”—an assumption of pompous titles characteristic
of the vaunting tone which continued to increase down to the Conquest.
(Supplemental Notes to the View of the Middle Ages, p. 199 <i>seq.</i>) This
however is hardly consistent with Beda and the Chronicle. The only
passage in its favour is that of Adamnan, and this is confined to one
prince. Adamnan however was a Kelt, and on this account I should
be cautious respecting any language he used. Again, I am not prepared
to admit the probability of a territorial title, at a time when kings were
kings of the people, not of the land. But most of all do I demur to the
reading Bretwalda itself, which rests upon the authority neither of coins
nor inscriptions, and is supported only by one passage of a very bad
manuscript; while it is refuted by five much better copies of the same
work, and a charter: I therefore do not scruple to say that there is no
authority for the word. In all but this I concur with Mr. Hallam,
whose opinion is a most welcome support to my own.</p>

the King was only one of the people<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a>, dependent
upon their election for his royalty, and upon their
support for its maintenance. But he was nevertheless
the noblest of the people, and at the head
of the state, as long as his reign was felt to be for
the general good, the keystone and completion of
the social arch. Accordingly he was invested with
various dignities and privileges, enabling him to
exercise public functions necessary to the weal of
the whole state, and to fill such a position in society
as belonged to its chief magistrate. Although his
life, like that of every other man, was assessed at a
fixed price,—the price of an æðeling or person of
royal blood,—it was further guarded by an equal
amount, to be levied under the name of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>cynebót</i></span>,
the price of his royalty; and the true character
of these distinctions is clear from the fact of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>first sum belonging to the family, the second to the
people<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>His personal rights, or royalties, consisted in the
possession of large domains which went with the
crown<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a>, a sort of τεμενος, which were his own property
only while he reigned, and totally distinct
from such private estates as he might purchase for
himself; in short his Woods and Forests, which the
Crown held under the guarantee and supervision
of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena gemót</span>. Also, in the right to receive
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>naturalia</i></span>, or voluntary contributions in kind from
the free men, which gradually became depraved
into compulsory payments. Of these the earliest
mention is by Tacitus<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a>, who tells us that it was the
custom, voluntarily and according to the power of
the people, to present their princes with cattle and
corn, which was not only a mark of honour but
a substantial means of support; and the annals of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the Frankish kings abound with instances of these
presentations, which generally took place at the
great meetings of the people, or Campus Madius<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a>.
His further privileges consisted in the right to receive
a portion of the fines payable for various
offences, and the confiscation of offenders’ estates
and chattels; in various distinctions of dress, dwelling,
and the like; above all, in the maintenance
of a standing army of comrades, called at a late
period Húscarlas or household troops. It was for
him to call together the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena gemót</span> or great
council of the realm, whenever occasion demanded,
and to lay before them propositions touching the
general welfare of the state; in concurrence also
with them, to extend or amend the existing legislation.
At the same time I do not find that he
possessed the power of dismissing these counsellors
when he thought he had had enough of their advice,
or of preventing them from meeting without
his special summons: in which two rights, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>injudiciously exercised, the historian finds the key
to the downfall of so many monarchies. As general
conservator of the public peace, both against
foreign and domestic disturbers, the king could call
out the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>fyrd</i></span>, an armed levy or militia of the freemen,
proclaim his peace upon the high-roads, and exact
the cumulative fines by which the breach of it was
punished. He was also the proper guardian of the
coinage; and, in some respects, the fountain of
justice, seeing that he might be resorted to, if justice
could not be obtained elsewhere. We may also
look upon him as, at least to a certain degree, the
fountain of honour, since he could promote his
comrades, thanes or ministers to higher rank, or to
posts of dignity and power. All these various rights
and privileges he possessed and exercised, by and
with the advice, consent and licence of his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena
gemót</span> or Parliament. It is desirable to consider
the various details connected with this subject, in
succession, and to illustrate them by examples from
Anglosaxon authorities.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although under a Christian dispensation the king
could no longer be considered as appertaining to
a family exclusively divine, yet the old national
tradition still aided in securing to him the highest
personal position in the commonwealth. He
had a wergyld indeed, but it far exceeded that of
any other class: nor was it in this alone that his
paramount dignity was recognized, but in the comparative
amount of the fines levied for offences
against himself, his dependents or his property.
And as the principle of all Teutonic law is, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>amount of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>bót</i></span> or compensation shall vary directly
with the dignity of the party leased, the high tariff
appointed for royalty is evidence that the king
really stood at the summit of the social order, and
was the first in rank and honour, whatever he may
have been in power. This is equally apparent in
the earliest law, that of Æðelberht, as in Eádweard
the Confessor’s, the latest. Thus, if he called his
Leóde, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fideles</i></span> or thanes, to him, and they were injured
on the way, a compensation double the ordinary
amount could be exacted, and in addition a
fine of fifty shillings to the king<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a>. And so likewise,
if he honoured a subject by drinking at his house,
all offences, then and there committed, were punishable
by a double fine<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a>. Theft from him bore a
ninefold, from a ceorl or freeman only a threefold,
compensation<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a>. His mundbyrd or protection was
valued at fifty shillings; that of an eorl and ceorl
at twelve and six respectively<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a>: this applied to the
cases where a man slew another in the king’s tún,
the eorl’s tún, or the ceorl’s edor<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a>; and to the dishonour
of his maiden-serf, which involved a fine of
fifty shillings, while the eorl’s female cupbearer was
protected only to the amount of twelve, the ceorl’s
to that of six shillings<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a>. His messenger or armourer,
if by chance they were guilty of manslaughter,
could only be sued for a mitigated wergyld, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>which they, though probably unfree, were placed
upon a footing of equality with the freeman<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a>. His
word, like that of a bishop, was to be incontrovertible,
that is, no oath could be tendered to rebut
it<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a>. He that fought in the king’s hall, if taken in
the act, was liable to the punishment of death, or
such doom as the king should decree<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a>: the king’s
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burhbryce</span>, or violence done to his dwelling, was
valued at 120 shillings, an archbishop’s at 90, a
bishop’s or ealdorman’s at 60, a twelfhynde man’s
at 30, a syxhynde’s at 15, but a ceorl’s or freeman’s
only at 5; and these sums were to be doubled
if the militia was on foot<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a>. His <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">borhbryce</span>, or
breach of surety, and his mundbyrd or protection
were raised by Ælfred to five pounds, while the
archbishop’s was valued at three, the bishop’s or
ealdorman’s at two pounds<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a>. He could give sanctuary
to offenders for nine days<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a>, and peculiar privileges
of the same kind were extended to those
monasteries which were subject to his farm or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pastus</i></span><a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a>.
His geneát or comrade, if of the noble class,
could swear for sixty hides of land<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a>. His horsewealh,
the Briton employed in his stables, was
placed on an equal footing with the freeman, at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>wergyld of 200 shillings<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a>; and even his godson had
a particular protection<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a>. Lastly, high-treason, by
compassing the king’s death, harbouring of exiles,
or of the king’s rebellious dependents, was made
liable to the punishment of death<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The political position of the king, at the head of
the state, was secured by an oath of allegiance taken
to him, by all subjects of the age of twelve years<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the ealdormen in the shires, the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span> in the
various districts or towns, summoned his witan and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the legal period of majority among the Germans,
for public purposes. In this capacity he appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>named the members of their body<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a>. In this capacity
he was empowered to inflict fines upon the
public officers, and even private individuals, for
such neglect of duty as endangered the public interests:
these fines were paid under the title of the
king’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">oferhýrnes</span>, literally his <em>disobedience</em>: thus,
if a man when summoned refuse to attend the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span>;
if a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> refuse to do justice, when called
upon, or to put the law in execution against offenders<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a>,
and in other similar cases where the whole
framework of society requires the existence of a
central support, having power to hold its scattered
elements together, and in their places.</p>

<p class='c001'>The maintenance of the public peace is the first
duty of the king, and he is accordingly empowered
to levy fines for all illegal breaches of it, by offences
against life, property or honour<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a>: in very
grave cases of continued guilt, he is even entrusted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>with the right of banishing and outlawing offenders,
whose wealth and family connexions seem to
place them beyond the reach of ordinary jurisdictions<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a>.
Where the course of private war is to be
settled by the legal compensations, it is the king’s
peace which is established between the contending
parties, the relatives and advocates of the slayer
and the slain<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a>. And in accordance with these
principles, we find the kings’s peace peculiarly proclaimed
upon the great roads which are the highways
of commerce and means of internal communication,
and the navigable streams by which cities
and towns are supplied with the necessary food for
their inhabitants<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a>. And hence also he was allowed
to proclaim his peace over all the land at certain
times and seasons; as, for eight days at his coronation,
and the same space of time at Christmas,
Easter and Whitsuntide. He might also, either by
his hand or writ, give the privileges of his peace to
estates which would otherwise not have possessed
it, and thus place them upon the same footing of
protection as his own private residences<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a>. The great
divisions of the country, that is the shires, could only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>be determined by the central power: it is therefore
provided that these shall be in the especial right
of the king: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Divisiones scirarum regis proprie
cum iudicio quatuor chiminorum regalium sunt</span><a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a>.”
And to the end of maintaining peace, it appears
to me that the king must also have been the authority
to whom, at least in theory, it was left
to settle the boundaries even of private estate;
which on the conversion of folcland into bócland,
he did, generally by his officers, but sometimes in
person<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the great machinery for keeping peace between
man and man, is the establishment of courts
of justice, and a system by which each man can
have law, by the consent and with the co-operation
of his neighbours, without finding it necessary to
arm in his own defence. It has been shown in the
First Book, that such means did exist in the Mark
and Gá courts; and that for nearly all the purposes
of society, it is sufficient and advisable that justice
should be done within the limits and by the authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>of the freemen. A centralized system however
brings modifications with it, even into the administration
of justice. If, as I believe, the original
king was a judge, who superinduced the warlike
upon his peaceful functions, we can easily see how,
with the growth of the monarchy, the judicial authority
of the king should become extended. I
cannot doubt that, in the historical times of the
Anglosaxons, the king was the fountain of justice;
by which expression I certainly do not mean that
every suit must be commenced in one of the superior
courts, or by an original writ, issuing out of
the royal chancery<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a>, but that the king was looked
upon as the authority by whom the judges were
supported and upheld, who was to be appealed to,
if no justice could be got elsewhere, and who had
the power to punish malversation in its administration
by his officers.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may leave the tale of Ælfred’s hanging the
unjust judges to the same veracious chapter of
history as records his invention of trial by jury:
but it is obvious, from the words of his biographer,
that he assumed some right to direct them in the
exercise of their functions. He there appears
not to have waited until complaints were made of
their maladministration; but to have adopted the
Frankish and Roman custom of dispatching <em>Missi</em>
or royal commissioners into the provinces subject
to his rule, in order to keep a proper check upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>proceedings of the public officers of justice. Asser
says,—and I record his words with the highest
respect and admiration of Ælfred’s real and great
deserts,—that “he investigated with great sagacity
the judgments given throughout almost all
his region, which had been delivered when he was
not present, as to what had been their character,
whether they were just, or unjust. And if he detected
any injustice in such judgments, he, either
in person, or by people in his confidence, mildly
enquired why the judges had given such unjust
decisions, whether through ignorance, or through
malversation of another kind, as fear, or favour,
or hope of gain. And then, if the judges admitted
that they had so decided, because they knew no
better in the premises, he would gently and moderately
correct their ignorance and folly, and say:
‘I marvel at your insolence, who, by God’s gift and
mine, have taken upon yourselves the ministry and
rank of wise men, but have neglected the study
and labour of wisdom. Now it is my command
that ye either give up at once the administration of
those secular powers which ye enjoy, or pay a much
more devoted attention to the studies of wisdom.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>A certain pedantry is obvious enough in all this
story, which, taken literally, under the circumstances
of the time, is merely childish. Still, as
Asser, though he may not entirely represent the
facts of this period<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a> in their true Germanic sense,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>does very likely represent some of the king’s private
wishes and opinions, this, among other passages,
may serve to show why, in spite of his great merits,
Ælfred once in his life had not a man to trust to
in his realm. Let us look at the matter a little
more closely. In the many kingdoms and districts
which by conquest or inheritance came under the
Westsaxon rule, various customary laws had prevailed<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c012'><sup>[61]</sup></a>.
It is very natural that judgments given
in accordance with these customs should often appear
inconsistent and discordant to a body of men
collected from different parts of the realm. Asser
is therefore very probably in the right, when he
says: “The nobles and non-nobles alike were frequently
at variance in the meetings of the comites
and praepositi, [that is, in the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena gemót</span>s,]
so that scarcely any one would admit the decisions
of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">comites</span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praepositi</span> [that is, in
the shire, hundred and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burhmót</span>] to be correct.”
But it is also probable that he misstates or overstates
the extent of the royal power, when he continues:
“But Ælfred, who for his own part knew
that some injustice arose thereby, was not very
willing to meddle with the decision of this judge
or that; although he was compelled thereunto both
by force of law and by stipulation<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>For in fact the king was the authority to be resorted
to in the last instance; not because he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>introduce a system of jurisprudence founded upon
Roman Decretals or Alaric’s Breviary,—which his
favourite advisers would probably have liked much
better than his ealdormen, præfects and people,—but
because he could lend the aid of the state to
enforce the judgments of the several courts, or
even compel the courts to give judgment, by reason
of the central power which he wielded as king.
As long however as the courts themselves were
willing to decide causes brought before them, which
the people assembled in the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemóts</span> did, under the
presidency and direction of the customary officers,
the king had no right to interfere: and even to
appeal to the king until justice had been actually
denied in the proper quarter was an offence under
the Saxon law, punishable by fine<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a>. In short, under
that law, the people were themselves the judges,
and helped the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> to find the judgment, be the
court what it might be. The king’s authority could
give no more than power to execute the sentence.
It is remarkable enough that while Asser speaks
of the instruction and correction which Ælfred administered
to his judges, he does not even insinuate
that their decisions were reversed,—a fact perfectly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>intelligible when we bear in mind that these decisions
were not those of judges in our sense of the
word, and as the Mirror plainly understood them,
but of the people in their own courts, finding the
judgment according to customary law. It would
have been a very different case had the courts been
the king’s courts; and in those where the class
called king’s thanes stood to right either before the
king himself, or the king’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>, it is possible that
Ælfred may have interfered. This he had full right
to do, inasmuch as these thanes were exclusively
his own sócmen, and must take such law as he
chose to give them<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c012'><sup>[64]</sup></a>. Indeed the words of Asser
seem reconcileable with the general state of the law
in Ælfred’s time only on the supposition that he
refers to these royal courts or þeningmanna gemót;
for the king could never have been expected to be
present at every shire- or hundred-mót, and yet
Asser says he diligently investigated such judgments
as were given when he was not present, almost
all over his region. This only becomes probable
when confined to the administration of justice
in the several counties in his own royal courts, and
by his own royal reeves, in whose method of proceeding
he was at liberty to introduce much more
extensive alterations at pleasure, than he could
have done in the customary law of the shires or
other districts.</p>

<p class='c001'>If however justice was entirely denied in the
shire or hundred, then, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>iure imperii</i></span>, the king had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the power of interfering: and as it seems clear that
such a case could only arise from the influence of
some great officer being exerted to prevent the due
course of law, it follows that the only remedy would
lie in the king’s power to repress him; either by
removing him from his office, if one derived from
the crown, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>iure belli</i></span>, putting him down as a nuisance
to the realm<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c012'><sup>[65]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the later times of the Anglosaxon monarchy,
a more immediate interference of the king in the
administration of justice is discernible. It consists
in what might be called the commendation of suits
to the notice of the proper courts: and this, which
was done by means of a writ or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>insigel</i></span>, probably at
first took place only in the case where a sócman of
the king was impleaded in the shiremoot touching
property subject to its jurisdiction, in fact where
one party was a free landowner, the other in the
king’s service or sócn; where of course the first
would not stand to right in the royal courts, but
before his peers in the shire or hundred<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a>. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>no mention in the laws of the Insigel or Breve<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a>,
but the charters give some evidence of what has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>been averred. In a very important record of the
time of <a id='corr48.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Æðelræd'>Æðelrǽd</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_48.2'><ins class='correction' title='Æðelræd'>Æðelrǽd</ins></a></span> (990-995) these words occur<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a>:—
“This writing showeth how Wynflǽd led her
witness at Wulfamere before King Æðelrǽd; now
that was Sigeríc the archbishop, and Ordbyrht the
bishop, and Ælfríc the ealdorman, and Ælfðrýð the
king’s mother: and they all bore witness that Ælfríc
gave Wynflǽd the land at Hacceburnan, and
at Brádan-felda in exchange for the land at Deccet.
Then at once the king sent by the archbishop
and them that bore witness with him, to Leófwine,
and informed him of this. But he would consent
to nothing, but that the matter should be brought
before the shiremoot. And this was done. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the king sent by Ælfhere the abbot, his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>insigel</i></span> to
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> at Cwichelmeshlǽw, and greeted all the
Witan who were there assembled,—that is, Æðelsige
the bishop, and Æscwig the bishop, and Ælfríc the
abbot, and all the shire, and bade them arbitrate
between Leófwine and Wynflǽd, as to them should
seem most just<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There can be no mistake about the fact; but it
does not amount to a proof that the cause could
not have been settled without this formality: both
parties to it were of the highest rank; but if the
king’s arbitration were refused, the title to the land
at Bradfield could legally be tried only in the county
of Berkshire in which it lay. Something similar
may have been intended by the notice which occurs
in the record of another <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">shiregemót</span> (held about
1038 at Ægelnóðes stán in Herefordshire) where it
is said that Tófig Prúda came thither <em>on the kings
errand</em><a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>PARDON.—When judgment was pronounced,
it appears that in certain cases, at least, the king
possessed the power to stay execution and pardon
the offender,—an exertion of the royal prerogative
which one feels pleasure in thus referring to so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>ancient a period. The necessary evidence is supplied
in many passages of the Laws<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ESCHEAT AND FORFEITURE.—As the
royal power became consolidated, and the great
struggle between centralization and local independence
assumed the new form of offences against the
state, the nature of punishments became somewhat
changed. The old pecuniary fines were found insufficient
to repress disorder, and forfeiture to the
king was resorted to, as a measure of increased
severity. The laws proclaim this in the case of
various breaches of the public peace: in treason
Ælfred’s witan decreed not only the punishment of
death, but also confiscation of all the possessions<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c012'><sup>[72]</sup></a>:
in addition to the capital penalty which was incurred
by fighting in the king’s house, forfeiture
of all the chattels was decreed by Ini<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a>. If a lord
maintained and abetted a notorious thief, he was to
forfeit all he had<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a>. And if he neglected the fines
provided, and would break the public peace either
by thieving or supporting thieves, it was provided
that the public authorities should ride to him, that
is make war upon him, and despoil him of all he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>had, whereof half was to go to the king, half to the
persons who took part in the expedition<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a>. But the
charters supply numerous instances of forfeiture in
consequence of crime, where the bóclands as well as
the chattels are seized into the king’s hand; though
in the case of folcland it is possible that the king
could not claim the forfeiture without a positive
grant of the witan. About 900, Helmstán having
been guilty of theft, Eánwulf, the king’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> at
Tisbury seized all his chattels to the king’s hand<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a>:
he held only lǽnland, and that could not be forfeited
by him; but the words made use of show,
that had it been his own bócland, it would not have
escaped. We have an instance of a thane forfeiting
lands to the king for adultery<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a>, although he
only held them on lease from the bishop of Winchester;
and in like manner, a lady was deprived of
her estate for incontinence<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a>. In 966 the bishop of
Rochester having obtained judgment and damages
against a lady, for forcible entry upon his lands
(reáflác), the sheriff of Kent seized her manors of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Fawkham and Bromley; all her possessions being
forfeited to the king<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a>: lastly in various instances
of theft, treason, and maintenance of ill-doers, we
learn that their lands were forfeited to the king<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>In a case of intestacy, where there were no legal
heirs, the king was allowed to enter upon the lands
of Burghard, probably because he had been a royal
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span><a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a>. And in the ninth century, Wulfhere, an
ealdorman, having deserted his duchy, his country
and his lord, without license, his lands were adjudged
as forfeit to the king<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a>. It would seem however
that the mere neglect to cultivate or inhabit
the land involved its confiscation to the king’s
hand<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a>, which may have been confined to folcland.</p>

<p class='c015'>FINES.—It is hardly necessary to enter into any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>great detail respecting the fines which were imposed
for various offences against the state, and
which were levied by the public officers to the king’s
use. The laws abound with examples: it may in
general be concluded that the proceeds were nearly
absorbed by the cost of collection, and that little
remained to the king when the portions of the
ealdorman and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> had been deducted. But
still these fines require a particular notice, because
they are especially enumerated by Cnut among
the rights of his crown. He says:—“These are
the rights which the king enjoys over all men in
Wessex: that is, Mundbryce, and Hámsócne, Foresteal,
Flýmena fyrmð, and Fyrdwíte, unless he
will more amply honour any one, and concede to
him this worship<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a>.” In Mercia, he declares himself
entitled to the same rights<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a>, and also by the
Danish law, that is in Northumberland and Eastanglia,—with
the addition of Fihtwíte, and the
fine for harbouring persons out of the Fríð or public
peace<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c012'><sup>[86]</sup></a>. These evidently belong to him in his
character of conservator of that peace: Mundbryce
is breach of his own protection: Hámsócn is an
aggravated assault upon a private dwelling: Foresteal
here, the maintenance of criminals and interference
to prevent the course of justice: Flýmena
fyrmð, the comforting and supporting of outlaws
or fugitives: Fyrdwíte, the penalty for neglecting
to attend, or for deserting, the armed levy when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>duly proclaimed: Fihtwíte is the penalty for making
private war. These regalia he could grant to
a subject if such were his pleasure. But they are
far from exhausting the catalogue of his rights: he
possessed many others, which were either honourable
or profitable, and were by him alienated in
favour of his lay or clerical favourites.</p>

<p class='c015'>TREASURE TROVE.—The first of these is
Treasure-trove, which was, in all probability, of considerable
importance and value: it is designated
in Anglosaxon charters by the words “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ealle hordas
búfan eorðan and binnan eorðan,</span>” and frequently
occurs in the grants to monastic houses. In very
early and heathen periods various causes combined
to render the burial of treasure common. It was
a point of honour to carry as much wealth with one
from this world to the next as possible; and it was
a recognized duty of the comites and household of
a chief to sacrifice at his funeral, whatever valuable
chattels they might have gained in his service.
We may infer from Beówulf<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c012'><sup>[87]</sup></a> that a portion at least
of the treasure he gained by his fatal combat with
the firedrake was to accompany him in the tomb.
Some of it was to be burnt with his body, but some,
according to the practice of the pagan North, to be
buried in the mound raised over his ashes<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c012'><sup>[88]</sup></a>.</p>

</table>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>When we consider the truly extraordinary number
of mounds or <em>heathen burial-places</em> which are mentioned
in the boundaries of Saxon charters, we
cannot doubt that large quantities of the precious
metals were thus committed to the earth. To this
superstitious cause others of a more practical nature
were added. In all countries where from want
of commerce and convenient internal communication,
or from general insecurity, there is no profitable
investment for capital, hoarding is largely
resorted to by those who may chance to become
possessed of articles of value: we need go no further
than Ireland or France for an example, where
one of the most striking signs of the prevalent
barbarism, is the concealment of specie and plate,
often underground<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c012'><sup>[90]</sup></a>. And in cases of sudden invasion,
especially by enemies who had not the
habit of sparing religious houses, the earth may have
been resorted to as the safest depository of treasure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>which it was impossible to transport<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c012'><sup>[91]</sup></a>. William of
Malmesbury attributes to the fears of the Britons
the accumulations which he says were frequently
discovered in his own day<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c012'><sup>[92]</sup></a>, and there can be little
doubt that this even among the Saxons tended to
increase the quantity of gold and silver withdrawn
from general use. It may have been partly the conviction
of the mischief resulting to society from
this habit,—by which gold was made “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">eldum swá
unnýt swá hit ǽror wæs,</span>”—that caused the very
frequent and strong expression of blame which we
find in Anglosaxon works applied to those who
bury treasure, and apparently also to treasure-hunters.
It may be that it was thought impious
to violate even the heathen sanctuary of the dead;
at all events, the popular belief was encouraged
that buried treasure was guarded by spells, watched
by dragons<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a>, and loaded with a curse which would
cleave for ever to the discoverer: hidden gold is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>fact always represented as <em>heathen</em> gold, which, we
may readily suppose, could only be purified from
its mischievous qualities by passing through the
hands of the universal purifiers in such cases, the
clergy. Strictly however the king was the proper
owner of all treasure-trove, and where the lord of
a manor obtained the right to appropriate it to himself,
it could only be by grant from the representative
of the whole state<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a>. Probably the sovereigns
were not quite so superstitious as the bulk of their
subjects, and certainly they were much better able
to defend their own rights than the simple landowners
in the rural districts. Still in a very great
number of cases they granted away their privilege;
probably finding it easier and more profitable to
give it up to those who would have used it, without
a grant, than to undergo the trouble of detecting
and punishing them for taking it unpermitted
into their own hands.</p>

<p class='c015'>PASTUS or CONVIVIUM, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Cyninges feorm</i></span>.—One
of the royal duties was to make, in person or
by deputy, periodical journeys through the country,
progresses, in the course of which the king visited
different districts, proclaimed his peace, confirmed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the rights and privileges of the freemen or free
communities, and heard complaints against the
officers of the executive, if such had arisen during
the exercise of their functions. This, which on
its first occurrence immediately after his election
was known in Germany by the name of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Einritt
ins land</em></span>, or <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Landbereisung</em></span><a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a>, was probably connected
with the principle of the king’s being the proper
guardian of the boundaries: and in the period when
the people had lost the power of electing their king
at a general meeting, it may have served the purpose
of giving them an opportunity of becoming
acquainted with the person of their ruler. It is
difficult to say when the system of progresses entirely
ceased; but there can be no doubt that it
subsisted in one form or another till a very late
period in England. Under the Anglosaxon law it
was by no means a matter of amusement or caprice,
but of positive duty, on the part of the king; and
Royalty <em>in eyre</em> was a necessary condition of a state
of society which would have rejected as a ludicrous
tyranny the pretension of any one city to be the
central deposit of all the powers and machinery of
government. The kings of the Merwingian race
in France, who probably retained something of an
old priestly character, made these circuits in the
celebrated chariot drawn by oxen, which later and
ill-informed writers have imagined was a sign of
their degradation, instead of their dignity<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a>. Of
this particular part of the ceremony no trace remains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>in England, and it is probable that as occasion
served, the king either rode on horseback,
circumnavigated, or was towed or rowed along the
navigable rivers<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c012'><sup>[97]</sup></a>. On these occasions particularly,
he had a right to claim harbour and refection for
himself and a certain number of his suite in various
places, principally religious houses. These claims,
which answer in many respects to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>procuratio</i></span>
of the ecclesiastical law, were gradually extended
so as to include the royal commissioners or <em>Missi</em>,
and in many cases became a fixed charge upon the
lands, whether the king actually visited them or not<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Very many of the charters granted to monasteries
record the exemption from them, purchased
at a heavy price by prelates, from his avarice or
piety<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c012'><sup>[99]</sup></a>. And as the king himself gradually ceased
to undertake these distant and fatiguing expeditions,
and entrusted to his special messengers the
task of seeing and hearing for him, so they in time
established a claim to harbourage and reception in
the same places. This was extended to all public
officers going on the king’s affairs, called Angelcynnes
men, Fæsting men, Rǽde fasting, and the
like: to all messengers dispatched on the public
service from one kingdom to another, while there
were several kingdoms; and very probably to
those who carried communications from the ealdormen
to the king, when one rule comprehended all
the several districts. And not only for those who
travelled on important affairs of state, and who were
very often persons of high birth and distinguished
station, but even for certain servants of the royal
household were these claims enforced. The huntsmen,
stable-keepers and falconers of the court could
demand bed and board in the monasteries, where
they were often unwelcome guests enough: and
this royal right, no doubt frequently used by the
ealdorman or sheriff as an engine of oppression,
was also bought off at very high prices.</p>

<p class='c015'>PALFREYS.—Somewhat allied to this was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>king’s right to claim the service of horses or palfreys,
for the carriage of effects from one royal vill
to another, or for the furtherance of his messengers
or the public servants<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c012'><sup>[100]</sup></a>. This, which in Hungary
still subsists under the name of Vorspann, was a
heavy burthen, as it tended to withdraw horses from
agricultural labour, at the moment when they were
most wanted; and it is to be feared that they were,
on this pretext, only too often taken from the harvesting
of the bishop or abbot and his tenants, to
secure that of the ealdorman. This therefore is
frequently compounded for, at a dear rate, under
the expression of freedom <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>a parafrithis</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>paraveredis</i></span><a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c012'><sup>[101]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>VIGILIA.—Another right which the king
claimed was that of having proper watch set over
him when he came into a district. This, called
Vigilia and Custodia in the Latin authorities, is
the Heáfodweard, or <em>Headward</em> of the Saxons. It
extended also to the guard kept for him on his
hunting excursions<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c012'><sup>[102]</sup></a>; and coupled with it was his
claim to the assistance of a certain number of men
in the hunt itself, either as beaters or managers of
the nets in which deer were taken<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c012'><sup>[103]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sǽweard or coast-guard was also a royal right,
performed by the tenants of those landowners whose
estates lay contiguous to the sea. The miserable
condition to which England was frequently reduced,
by the systematic incursions of Scandinavian invaders,
rendered this a very important duty, even
in spite of the efforts of successive kings who early
comprehended the destinies of this nation, and
entrusted her defence to maritime armaments. It
seems probable that various ports on the coast
of Kent and Norfolk may have been particularly
charged with this burthen, and that the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>butsecarlas</i></span>
or shipmasters were held bound to supply craft on
emergencies, or even for a regular system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>patrolling. In this may have lain the foundation of
the privileges enjoyed by the Cinque Ports, and
similar coast towns, even before the Norman conquest.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆDIFICATIO.—It was further a royal right to
claim the aid even of the freemen towards building
and fencing the residence or fortress of the king:
a certain amount of personal labour was thus demanded
of them, in analogy with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>trinoda necessitas</i></span>
from which no estate could possibly be relieved.
This kind of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>corvée</em></span> was no doubt performed
by tenants whom the landowners settled on their
estates, but really was due from the landowners
themselves, except where their estates of bócland
had been expressly freed from the royal burthens.
Where the royal vill was also a district fortification,
not even this general exception relieved the
bóclands; fortifications being especially reserved
in every charter, as well as building and repair of
bridges.</p>

<p class='c015'>WRECK.—Doubts have been started upon the
subject of wreck, which do not appear well founded:
it is true that circumstances of suspicion attach to
the documents upon which the arguments pro and
con were based in the time of Selden; but we
are now in possession of further evidence, of a
nature to remove all difficulty. I have no hesitation
in including Wreck, both jetsam and flotsam,
among the Regalia, which were granted not only to
ecclesiastical corporations, but even to private landowners.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>The History of Ramsey<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c012'><sup>[104]</sup></a> states that Eádweard
the Confessor, whereby he might show a profitable
love to the place, bestowed upon it Ringstede<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c012'><sup>[105]</sup></a>
with the adjacent liberty, and all that the
sea cast up, which is called <em>Wreck</em>. We have yet
the charter by which this grant is supposed to
have been made<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c012'><sup>[106]</sup></a>, and it is very explicit upon the
subject. After conveying lands and other possessions
in Huntingdonshire, he proceeds to give several
places, tenements or rents, on the coast of Norfolk
and the Wash, at Wells, and Branchester, etc.
In the last-named place, he adds, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum omni
maris proiectu, quod nos anglicè shipwrec appellamus.</span>”
He further adds, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de meo iure quod mihi
soli competebat, absque ullius reclamatione vel contradictione
ista addidi: inprimis Ringested, cum
omnibus ad se pertinentibus, et cum omni maris
eiectu, quod shipwrec appellamus,</span>” etc. Now, although
the authenticity of this charter, in its present
form may be open to question, this fact does
not of itself justify us in at once concluding against
the privilege claimed under it. On the other hand
the recognized right of the king throughout the
Norman times, and the total absence of any opposition
to its exercise, are <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>primâ facie</i></span> evidence of its
having resided in the crown before the Conquest<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c012'><sup>[107]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Naufragium and Algarum maris are distinctly stated
to be rights of the crown, in the laws of Henry the
First<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c012'><sup>[108]</sup></a>, and we can give examples from other Saxon
charters whose genuineness is beyond dispute. The
Saxon Chronicle under the date 1029 records a
grant made by Cnut to Christchurch, Canterbury,
of the haven of Sandwich. The passage is defective,
but enough of it remains to prove that it refers to
an original document, of which very early copies are
still in our possession<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c012'><sup>[109]</sup></a>. In this he says:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Concedo eidem aecclesiae ad victum monachorum
portum de Sanduuíc et omnes exitus eiusdem
aquae, ab utraque parte fluminis cuiuscumque terra
sit, a Pipernæsse usque ad Mearcesfleóte, ita ut
natante nave in flumine, cum plenum fuerit, quam
longius de navi potest securis parvula quam Angli
vocant <em>Tapereax</em> super terram proici, ministri aecclesiae
Christi rectitudines accipiant, ... Si quid
autem in magno mari extra portum, quantum mare
plus se retraxerit, et adhuc statura unius hominis
tenentis lignum quod Angli nominant <em>spreot</em>,
et tendentis ante se quantum potest, monachorum
est. Quicquid etiam ex hac parte medietatis maris
inventum et delatum ad Sanduuíc fuerit, sive sit
vestimentum, sive rete, arma, ferrum, aurum, argentum,
medietas monachorum erit, alia pars remanebit
inventoribus.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>These words are quite wide enough to carry
<em>wreck</em>, although this be not distinctly stated by
name. But Eádweard the Confessor furnishes us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>with still further evidence. In a writ addressed by
him to Ælfwold bishop of Sherborne, earl Harold,
and Ælfred the sheriff of Dorsetshire, he says<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c012'><sup>[110]</sup></a>:
“Eádweard the king greets well Bishop Ælfwold,
earl Harold, Ælfred the sheriff and all my thanes
in Dorsetshire: and I tell you that Urk my húscarl
is to have his strand, over against his own land,
freely and well throughout, up from sea, and out
on sea, and whatsoever may be driven to his strand,
by my full command.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In this, as in many other cases, the principle
seems to be, that that which has no ostensible
owner is the property of the state, or of the king
as its representative; and hence, in the later construction
of the law of <em>wreck</em>, it was necessary that
an absolute abandonment should have taken place,
before wreck could be claimed. If there were <em>life</em>
on board, even a dog, cat, or lower animal, there
could legally be no wreck, and this provision of the
law has very often led to the perpetration of the
most savage murders, as a precaution lest any living
creature, by reaching the strand, should defeat the
avarice of its barbarous owners. From the little
evidence we can now recover, of the Saxon practice,
this limitation does not appear to have existed.</p>

<p class='c015'>MINT.—The coinage has always in every country
been numbered among the regalia, and this
land appears to make no exception. Although the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena gemót</span>, in conjunction with the king, exercise
a general superintendence over this most important
branch of the public affairs, still certain
details remain which belong to the king exclusively.
The number of moneyers generally in the various localities,
the necessity of having one standard over all
the realm, the penalties for unfaithful discharge of
the moneyer’s duty, or for fraudulently imitating the
money of the state, and similar enactments, might
be determined by the great council of the realm;
but the coin bore the image and superscription of
the king, he received a description of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>seigneuriage</em></span>
upon delivery of the dies, and he changed the coin
when it seemed to require renovation or improvement.
Thus we learn that Eádgár called in the old,
and issued a new coinage, in the year 975, because
it had become so clipped as to fall far short of the
standard weight<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c012'><sup>[111]</sup></a>: and in the Domesday record, the
dues payable to the king on each change of die are
noticed<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c012'><sup>[112]</sup></a>. It seems clear that this royal right had
been assumed by private individuals, or granted
to them, like other royalties, previous to the time of
Æðelrǽd: that prince enacted not only that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>should be no moneyers beside the kings, but also that
their number should be altogether diminished<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c012'><sup>[113]</sup></a>;
by which we may suppose that it was his intention
to do away with the mints which the bishops
had before possessed legally<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c012'><sup>[114]</sup></a> in various towns, and
which from the passages cited out of Domesday
book, evidently continued to subsist, in spite of
the provisions of the Council of Wantage. But
if the coins themselves are to be trusted, we may
conclude that on some occasions this right had been
granted by the crown to others than the clergy.
One piece still bears the name and head of Cyneðrýð,
probably Offa’s queen<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c012'><sup>[115]</sup></a>; and another with the
impress of Hereberht, was probably coined by a
Kentish duke. Both these cases, which are in themselves
doubtful, are a hundred years earlier than
Æðelrǽd’s law, above quoted.</p>

<p class='c015'>MINES.—Mines and minerals are also among
the regalia of a German king, and were so in England.
The cases which principally come under our
observation in the charters are salt-works and lead-mines;
but in a document of the year 689, which
however is not totally free from suspicion, Osuuini
of Kent grants to Rochester a ploughland at Lyminge
in Kent, in which he says there is a mine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of iron<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c012'><sup>[116]</sup></a>. In 716, Æðelbald of Mercia granted
certain salt-works near the river Salwarpe at Lootwíc
in Worcestershire, in exchange however for
others to the north of the river<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c012'><sup>[117]</sup></a>. In the same
year he granted a hid of land in Saltwych, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vico
emptorio salis</i></span>, to Evesham<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c012'><sup>[118]</sup></a>. In 732, Æðelberht of
Kent gave abbot Dun a quarter of a ploughland
at Lyminge, where there were salt-works, that is
evaporating pans<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c012'><sup>[119]</sup></a>, and added to it a grant of a hundred
loads of wood per annum, necessary to the
operation. In 738 Eádberht of Kent includes salt-works
in a grant to Rochester<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c012'><sup>[120]</sup></a>, and similarly in
812, 814, Coenuulf, in grants to Canterbury<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c012'><sup>[121]</sup></a>. In
833 Ecgberht gave salt-works in Kent, and a hundred
and twenty loads of wood from the weald of
Andred, to support the fires<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c012'><sup>[122]</sup></a>. Three years later
Wigláf of Mercia confirmed the liberties of Hanbury
in Worcestershire, with all its possessions, including
salt-wells and lead-works<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c012'><sup>[123]</sup></a>. In 863, Æðelberht
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>granted salt-works in Kent to Æðelred, with
four waggons going for six weeks into the royal
forest<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c012'><sup>[124]</sup></a>. In 938, Æðelstán gave to Taunton three
híds of land, and salt-pans<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c012'><sup>[125]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The king in all these cases had possessed a right
to levy certain dues at the pans or the pit’s mouth,
upon the waggons as they stood, and upon the load
being placed in them: these dues were respectively
called the wǽnscilling and seámpending, literally
<em>wainshilling</em> and <em>loadpenny</em>, and were entirely independent
of the rent which might be reserved by
the landlord for the use of the ground, whether he
were the king or a private person. And immunity
from these dues might also be granted by the crown,
and was so granted. In 884, Æðelred, duke of
Mercia, who acted as a viceroy in that new portion
of Ælfred’s kingdom, and exercised therein all the
royal rights as fully as any king did in his own
territories, gave Æðelwulf five híds at Humbleton,
and licence to have six salt-pans, free from all
the dues of king, duke or public officer, but still
reserving the rights of the landlord<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c012'><sup>[126]</sup></a>. But the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>same prince, about the same period, when conferring
various royalties upon the cathedral of Worcester,
retained the king’s dues at the pans in Saltwíc<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c012'><sup>[127]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The peculiar qualities of salt, which make it a
necessary of life to man, have always given a special
character to the springs and soils which contain
it. The pagan Germans considered the salt-springs
holy, and waged wars of extermination for their
possession<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c012'><sup>[128]</sup></a>; and it is not improbable that they may
generally have belonged to the exclusive property
of the priesthood. If so, we can readily understand
how, upon the introduction of Christianity, they
would naturally pass into the hands of the king:
and this seems to throw light upon the origin of
this royalty, which Eichhorn himself looks upon
as difficult of explanation<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c012'><sup>[129]</sup></a>. Many of the royal
rights were unquestionably inherited from the pagan
priesthood.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>MARKET.—The grant of a market, with power
to levy tolls and exercise the police therein, was
also a royalty, in the period of the consolidated
monarchy; and to this head may be added the
right to keep a private beam or steelyard, <em>trutina</em>
or <em>tróne</em>, yard-measure, and bushel. Of these the
charters supply examples. The last-named rights
were purchased in 857 by bishop Alhhun of Worcester,
from Burgred, who, as king of Mercia, disposed
of them to him, with a small plot of land in
London. The price paid was sixty shillings, or a
pound, to Ceólmund, the owner of the land, a like
sum to the king, and an annual rent of twelve shillings
to the latter<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c012'><sup>[130]</sup></a>. Thirty-two years later, Ælfred
and Æðelred of Mercia gave another small plot in
the same city to Werfrið, also bishop of Worcester.
He was to have a steelyard, and a measure, both
for buying and selling, or for his own private use.
And if any of his people dealt in the street or on
the bank where the sales took place, the king was
to have his toll: but if the bargain was struck within
the bishop’s <em>curtis</em>, he was to have the toll<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c012'><sup>[131]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 904 Eádweard gave a market in Taunton to
the bishop of Winchester, with the toll therefrom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>arising, by the name of “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ðæs túnes cýping</span>”<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c012'><sup>[132]</sup></a>: and
a few years earlier Æðelred of Mercia granted half
the market-dues and fines at Worcester to the
bishop of that city<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c012'><sup>[133]</sup></a>. The Frankish emperors possessed
and exercised the same right<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c012'><sup>[134]</sup></a>. The strict
law of the Anglosaxons, which treated all strangers
with harshness, was unfavourable to the chapmen
or pedlars, who in thinly-peopled countries are
relied upon to bring markets home to every one’s
door: and it must be admitted that, where internal
communication is yet imperfect, stringent measures
are necessary to guard against the disposal of goods
improperly obtained. The details of these measures
belong to another part of this work, but it is necessary
to call attention here to the endeavour on
the part of the authorities, to confine all bargaining
as much as possible to towns and walled places<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c012'><sup>[135]</sup></a>:
the small tolls payable on these occasions to the
proper officers were a reasonable sacrifice for the
sake of a certificate of fair dealing, and the assured
warranty of what the Saxon law calls <em>unlying</em>
witnesses. The king, as general conservator of
the peace, had this royalty, and, as we have seen,
granted it in various towns to those who would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>be able and willing to perform the duties which it
implied.</p>

<p class='c015'>TOLL.—Closely connected with this are tolls,
which, here as well as in Germany, the king claimed
in harbours, and upon transport by roads and
by navigable streams<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c012'><sup>[136]</sup></a>, and which he either remitted
altogether in favour of certain favoured persons or
empowered them to take; thus, in the first instance,
creating for them a commercial monopoly of the
greatest value, by enabling them to enter the market
on terms of advantage. As early as the eighth
century we find Æðelbald of Mercia granting to a
monastery in Thanet, exemption from toll throughout
his kingdom for one ship of burthen<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c012'><sup>[137]</sup></a>, remitting
to Milræd, bishop of Worcester, the dues upon two
ships, payable in the port of London<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c012'><sup>[138]</sup></a>, and to the
bishop of Rochester the toll of one ship, whether
his own or another’s, in the same port<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c012'><sup>[139]</sup></a>. And the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>grant to St. Mildðrýð in Thanet was confirmed for
himself, and increased by Eádberht of Kent in 761,
and extended to London, Fordwíc and Seorre<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c012'><sup>[140]</sup></a>; and
if the actual ship to which this privilege was attached
should become unseaworthy through age,
or perish by shipwreck, a new one was to receive
the same favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>A common privilege in charters of liberties is
Tol, but this probably refers rather to a right of
taking it upon sales within the jurisdiction, than
properly to dues levied on transport. Such however
are occasionally mentioned as matter of grant.
Eádmund Irensída, conveying lands which had belonged
to Sigeferð (whose widow he had married),
includes toll upon water-carriage among his rights<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c012'><sup>[141]</sup></a>.
Cnut gave the harbour and tolls of Sandwich to
Christchurch Canterbury<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c012'><sup>[142]</sup></a>, together with a ferry.
This right, under Harald Haranfót, was attempted
to be interfered with by the abbot of St. Augustine’s,
who even at last went so far as to dig a canal
in order to divert the channel of trade; but the
monks of Christchurch nevertheless succeeded in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>retaining their property<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c012'><sup>[143]</sup></a>. These examples, although
not very numerous, are sufficient to show that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Anglosaxon kings fully possessed the right of levying
and granting toll, as well as exemption from
its payment; and they are sufficiently confirmed by
Domesday and the laws of the kings themselves<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c012'><sup>[144]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>FOREST.—It may be doubted whether the right
of Forest was at any time carried among the Saxons
to the extent which made it so hateful a means of
oppression under the Norman kings; but there can
be no question that it was one of the royalties. In
every part of Germany the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bannum Forestae</i></span> or <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Forstbann</em></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>was so<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c012'><sup>[145]</sup></a>, and even to this day is as much an
object of popular dislike in some districts as it ever
was among our forefathers. In countries which depend
much upon the immediate produce of the soil
for support, hunting is not a mere amusement to
be purchased or rented by the rich as a luxury, but
a very necessary means of increasing the supply of
food; and where coal-mines have not been worked,
the forest alone or the turf-heap can furnish the
means of securing warmth, as indispensable a necessary
of life as bread or flesh: we have seen moreover
that it was essential to the comfort of a Saxon
family to possess a right of masting cattle in the
neighbouring woods.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the original division of the lands large tracts
of forest may have fallen to the king’s share, which
he could dispose of as his private property. Much
of the folcland also may have been covered with
wood, and here and there may have lain sacred
groves not included within the limits of any community<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c012'><sup>[146]</sup></a>.
It is not unreasonable to suppose that
all these were gradually brought under the immediate
influence and authority of the king; and that
when once the royal power had so far advanced as
to reduce the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scír-geréfa</span> to the condition of a crown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>officer, the shire-marks or forests would also become
subject to the royal <em>ban</em><a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c012'><sup>[147]</sup></a>. That very considerable
forest rights still continued to subsist in
the hands of the free men, in their communities,
may be admitted, and is evidence of the firm foundation
for popular liberty which the old Mark-organization
laid. But even in these, the possession
was not left totally undisturbed, and the public
officers, the king, ealdorman and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> appear to
have gradually made various usurpations valid.</p>

<p class='c001'>Over his private forests the king naturally exercised
all the rights of absolute ownership; and as
his <em>ban</em> ultimately implies this, at least in theory,
it becomes difficult to distinguish those which he
dealt with as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dominus fundi</i></span>, from those in which he
acted <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>iure regali</i></span>. That he reserved the vert and
venison in some of them, and <em>preserved</em> with a
strictness worthy of more enlightened ages, is clear
from the severe provisions of Cnut’s Constitutiones
de Foresta<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c012'><sup>[148]</sup></a>. According to this important
document, the forest law was as follows. In every
county there were to be four thanes, whose business
it was, under the title of Head-foresters, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>primarii
forestae</i></span>, to hold plea of all offences touching the
forest, and having the <em>ban</em> or power of punishing
for such offences. Under them were sixteen lesser
thanes, but gentlemen, whose business it was to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>look after the vert and venison; and these had nothing
to do with the process in the forest court.
To each of the sixteen were assigned two yeomen,
who were to keep watch at night over the vert and
venison, and do the necessary menial services: but
they were freemen, and even employment in the
forest gave freedom. All the expenses of these officers
were defrayed by the king, and he further supplied
the outfit of the several classes: to the head-foresters,
yearly, two horses, one saddled, a sword,
five lances, a spear, a shield and two hundred shillings
of silver: to the second class, one horse, one
lance, one shield and sixty shillings: to the yeomen,
a lance, a cross-bow and fifteen shillings. All
these persons were quit and free of all summonses,
county-courts, and military dues: but the two secondary
classes owed suit and surface to the court of
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>primarii</i></span> (<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Swánmót</span>), which held plea and gave
judgment in their suits: in those of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>primarii</i></span>
themselves, the king was sole judge. The court
of the Forest was to be held four times a year, and
was empowered to administer the triple ordeal,
and generally to exercise such a jurisdiction as belonged
only to the higher and royal courts. The
persons of the head-foresters were guarded by
severe penalties; violence offered to them was punished
in a free man with loss of liberty, in a serf
with loss of the hand; and a second offence entailed
the penalty of death.</p>

<p class='c001'>The offences against the forest-law were various
and of very different degrees: the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ferae forestae</i></span>
were not nearly so sacred as the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ferae regales</i></span>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>as for the <em>vert</em>, it was of so little regard that the
law hardly contemplated it, always excepting the
breaking the king’s chace. To hunt a beast of the
forest (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fera forestae</i></span>), either voluntarily or intentionally,
till it panted, was punished in a free man
by a fine of ten shillings: in one of a lower grade<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c012'><sup>[149]</sup></a>,
by a fine of twenty: in a serf, by a flogging. But
if it were a royal beast (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fera regalis</i></span>) which the
English call a stag, the punishments were to be
respectively, one and two years servitude, and for
the serf, outlawry. If they killed it, the free man
was to lose <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>scutum libertatis</i></span><a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c012'><sup>[150]</sup></a>, the next man his liberty,
and the serf his life. Bishops, abbots and
barons were not to be vexed with prosecutions for
hunting, except they killed stags: in that case they
were liable to such penalty as the king willed. Besides
the beasts of the forest, the roebuck, hare and
rabbit were protected by fines. Wolves and foxes
were neither beasts of the forest nor chace, and
might be killed with impunity, but not within the
bounds of the forest, as that would be a breaking
of the chace; nor was the boar considered a beast
of venery. No one was to cut brushwood without
permission of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>primarius</i></span>, under a penalty; and
he that felled a tree which supplied food for the
beasts, was to pay a fine of twenty shillings over
and above that for breaking the chace. Every
free man might have his own vert and venison on
his own lands, but without a chace; and no man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>of the middle class (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mediocris</i></span>) was to keep greyhounds.
A gentleman (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liberalis</i></span><a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c012'><sup>[151]</sup></a>) might, but he must
first have the knee-sinew cut in presence of the
head-forester, if he lived within ten miles of the
forest: if his dogs came within that distance, he was
to be fined a shilling a mile: if the dog entered the
precincts of the forest, his master was to pay ten
shillings. Other kinds of dogs, not considered dangerous,
might be kept without mutilation; but if
they became mad and by the negligence of their
masters went wandering about, heavy fines were
incurred. If found within the bounds of the forest,
the fine was two hundred shillings: if such a rabid
dog bit a beast of the forest, the fine rose to twelve
hundred: but if a royal beast was bitten, the crime
was of the deepest dye.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such is the forest legislation of Cnut, and its severity
is of itself evidence how much the power of
the king had become extended at the commencement
of the eleventh century. It is clear that he
deals with all forests as having certain paramount
rights therein, and it seems probable that this organization
was intended to be established all over
England. Still it is observable that he gives certain
rights of hunting to all his nobles, reserving
only the stags to himself, and that he allows every
freeman to hunt upon his own property, so that he
does not interfere with the royal chaces<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c012'><sup>[152]</sup></a>. We may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>however infer that at an earlier period the matter
was not regarded so strictly. A passage has been
already cited<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c012'><sup>[153]</sup></a> where Ælfred implies that a dependent
living upon lǽnland could support himself by
hunting and fishing, till he got bócland of his own.
The bishops possessed the right in their forests—whether
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>proprio iure</i></span> or by royal grant, I will not
venture to decide—as early as the ninth century<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c012'><sup>[154]</sup></a>,
and still retained it in the tenth<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c012'><sup>[155]</sup></a>. And while the
communities were yet free it is absurd to suppose
that they allowed any one to interfere with this pursuit,
so attractive to every Teuton, so healthy, so calculated
to practise his eye and limbs for the sterner
duties of warfare, and so useful to recruit a larder
not over well stored with various or delicate viands.</p>

<p class='c001'>However this may have been with the game, it
is certain that the most important privileges were
those of masting swine, and cutting timber or brushwood
in the forests<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c012'><sup>[156]</sup></a>. Grants to this effect are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>common, and it is plain that a considerable quantity
of woods were in the hands of corporations, and
even of private individuals, as well as of the Crown.
How they came into private hands is not clear;
some perhaps by bargain and sale, some by inheritance,
some by grant, some no doubt by usurpation.
The most powerful markman may at last
have contrived to appropriate to himself the ownership
of what woodland remained, though he was
still compelled to permit the hereditary axe to ring
in the forest<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c012'><sup>[157]</sup></a>; and all experience shows that both
here and in Germany monasteries were often
founded in the bosom of woods, granted for religious
purposes, out of what perhaps had once endowed
an earlier religion, and which supplied at
once building materials, fuel and support for cattle<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c012'><sup>[158]</sup></a>.
But even in these, it seems that the king,
the duke and the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> interfered, claiming a right
to pasture certain numbers of their own swine
or cattle in them, and to give this privilege to
others.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 845, Æðelwulf gave pasture to Badonoð for
his cattle with the king’s beasts, apparently in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>pastures of the town of Canterbury<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c012'><sup>[159]</sup></a>. In 855, the
same king gave his thane Dun a tenement in Rochester,
together with two waggon-loads of wood
from the king’s forest, and common in the marsh<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c012'><sup>[160]</sup></a>.
In 839 he licensed for Dudda two waggons to the
common wood, probably Blean<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c012'><sup>[161]</sup></a>; in 772, Offa
granted lands to Abbot Æðelnoð, and added a perpetual
right of pasture and masting in the royal
wood, together with licence for one goat to go with
the royal flock in the forest of Sænling<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c012'><sup>[162]</sup></a>. Numerous
other examples are supplied by the charters,
which may be classed under the following heads:
first, royal forests, as Sænling, Blean, Andred and
the like, called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>silvae regales</i></span>, and in which the king
granted timber, common of mast and pasture or
estovers: secondly, forest appertaining to cities
and communities (ceasterwara-weald, burhwara-weald,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>silva communis</i></span>), in which the king granted
commons: thirdly, small woods, appurtenant to
and part of estates, but not named, and the enjoyment
of which is conveyed in the general terms of
the grant, as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>terram cum communibus utilitatibus,
pascuis, pratis, silvis, piscariis</i></span>, etc.: lastly, private
forests or commons of forest specially named as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>appurtenant to particular estates, or given by favour
of the king to the tenant of those estates.
To all these heads ample references will be found
in the note below<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c012'><sup>[163]</sup></a>. His right to deal at pleasure
with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>silvae regales</i></span> requires no particular notice,
but the grants of pasture and timber in the forests
of cities and communities<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c012'><sup>[164]</sup></a> can only be explained
by the assumption of a paramount royalty in the
Crown. And that this was exercised in the private
forests of monasteries, also appears from exemptions
sometimes purchased by them. In 706,
Æðelweard of the Hwiccas consented to confine his
right of pasture to one herd of swine, and that only
in years when mast was abundant, in the forests
belonging to Evesham; and he released them from
all claims of princes and officers, except this one
of his own<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c012'><sup>[165]</sup></a>. Similarly, with regard to timber,
Ecgberht in 835 gave an immunity to Abingdon,
against the claim of king or prince, to take large
or small wood for his buildings from the forests of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the monastery<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c012'><sup>[166]</sup></a>. This right of the king to timber
for public purposes was maintained and claimed till
the time of the rebellion, and was a fertile source
of malversation and extortion<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c012'><sup>[167]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>STRANGER.—To the king belonged also the
protection of all strangers within his realm, and the
consequent claim to a portion of their wergyld, and
their property in case of death, a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>droit d’aubaine</i></span>.
This was a natural deduction from the principles
of a period and a state of society in which every
man’s security was founded upon association either
with relatives or guildsmen: and as no one could
have these in a foreign mark,—the associations
being themselves in intimate connection with the
territory,—it is obvious that the public authorities
alone could exercise any functions in behalf of the
solitary chapman. As general conservator of the
peace, these necessarily fell to the king; but the
duties and advantages which he thus assumed became
in turn matter of grant, and were conferred
by him upon other public persons or corporations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The laws declare the king, earl and bishop to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>the relatives and guardians of the stranger<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c012'><sup>[168]</sup></a>; and
the charters show that the consequent gains were
alienated by him at his pleasure. In 835, Ecgberht
gave the inheritance of Gauls and Britons,
and half their wergyld, to the monastery at Abingdon<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c012'><sup>[169]</sup></a>.
Among these strangers, the Jews were especially
mentioned. Anglosaxon history has not
indeed recorded any of those abominable outrages
upon this long-suffering people which fill the annals
of our own and other countries during the middle
ages; but there can be no doubt that a false and
fanatical view of religion, if not their way of life
and their accumulations, must have ever marked
them out for persecution. Eichhorn has justly
characterized the feeling which prevailed respecting
them in all parts of Europe<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c012'><sup>[170]</sup></a>, and has remarked
to the honour of the Popes that they were the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>to preach toleration and command the attempt at
conversion. But the utility of the Jewish industry
especially in thinly peopled countries, and their
importance as gatherers of capital, were ever engaged
in a struggle against bigotry; hence the
Jews could generally obtain a qualified protection
against all but sudden outbreaks of popular fury.
As these latter had mostly other deep-seated causes,
the ruling classes may sometimes have seen without
regret the popular indignation vent itself in
a direction which did not immediately endanger
themselves: but as a general rule, the Jews enjoyed
protection, and were made to pay dearly for it.
Both parties were gainers by the arrangement.
Among the Saxons this could not be otherwise, for
it was impossible for a Jew to be in a hundred or
tithing as a freeman; and he would probably have
had but little security in the household and following
of an ordinary noble. The readiest and most
effective plan was to place him, wherever he might
be, especially under the king’s mundbyrd. Accordingly
the law of Eádweard the Confessor declares
the king to be protector of all Jews<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c012'><sup>[171]</sup></a>, and
this right descended to his Norman successors. Similarly
as the clergy relinquished their mǽsceaft
or bond of kin, on entering into orders, the king
became their natural mundbora<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c012'><sup>[172]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>BRIDGE.—It is probable that no one could
build a bridge without the royal licence, though I
am not aware of any instance in the Saxon times:
but I infer this from grants of the Frankish emperors
and kings to that effect<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c012'><sup>[173]</sup></a>. It is possible that
this may have depended upon the circumstance
that toll would be taken by the owner of such a
bridge; but we may believe that other reasons concurred
with this, and that the bridge originally had
something of a holy character, and stood in near
relation to the priesthood<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c012'><sup>[174]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>CASTLE.—In like manner we may doubt whether
the kings did not gradually draw into their
own hands the right to have fortified houses or
castles, which we find them possessing in the Norman
times, and which they extended to their
adherents and favourites by special licence. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>mediæval history, the fortification of their houses
by the inhabitants of a city is the very first result
of the establishment of a Communa, commune or
free municipality; and the destruction of such fortifications
the first care of the victorious count,
bishop or king upon his triumph over the <em>outrecuidance</em>
of the burghers<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c012'><sup>[175]</sup></a>. The clearest instance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the royal licence to a subject is a grant of Æðelræd
and Æðelflæd to the bishop of Worcester,
about 880, which recites that they built a burh or
fortress for him, in his city, probably to defend his
cathedral in those stormy days of Danish ravage<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c012'><sup>[176]</sup></a>.
In very early times there may have been fortresses
belonging to private persons; this may be inferred
from names of places such as Sulmonnes burh,
<i>Sulman’s castle</i>; and under the later Anglosaxon
kings, various great nobles may have obtained the
privilege of fortifying their own residences, as for
example we read of Pentecost’s castle and Rodberht’s
castle under Eádweard the Confessor<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c012'><sup>[177]</sup></a>, an
example very likely to have been followed by the
powerful chieftains of Godwine’s, Sigeweard’s and
Leófríc’s families; but the cases were probably few.
Of course fortresses built and garrisoned by the
king for the public defence are quite another matter:
these were imperial, and to their construction,
maintenance and repair, every estate throughout
the land, whether of folcland or bócland, was inevitably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>bound, not even excepting the demesne
lands of the king himself or of the ecclesiastical
corporations.</p>

<p class='c015'>ROADS and CANALS.—There is no very clear
evidence respecting roads and canals, licence to
make which was a subject of grant by the Frankish
emperors<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c012'><sup>[178]</sup></a>. But except as regarded the great
roads which were especially the king’s, and the
cross roads, which were the county’s, it is probable
that there was no interference on the part of
the state. Every landowner must have had the
privilege of making private paths, large or small
at his pleasure, by which access could be given to
different parts of his own property. We do occasionally
find roads mentioned by the name of the
owners, and a common service of the settlers on an
estate was the liability to assist in making a new
road to the farm or mansion<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c012'><sup>[179]</sup></a>. In an instance
already cited we have seen an abbot of St. Augustine’s
digging a canal with the object of diverting
traffic from the haven of Sandwich. It may unhesitatingly
be asserted that he claimed this right
under his general power as a landlord, and not by
any special grant for the purpose: this is evident
from the whole tenour of the narrative.</p>

<p class='c015'>PORTS.—Ports and Havens were, however, essentially
royalties, and, as we have seen, could be
granted to religious houses. They were naturally in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the king’s hand, for this reason: in the early times
of which we treat, the stranger is looked upon as an
enemy, and every one who does not belong to the
association for the maintenance of peace, is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>primâ
facie</i></span> out of the peace altogether. This applies to
sailors, as well as travelling chapmen who wander
from mark to mark or county to county; and it applied
with peculiar force to England after her coasts
became exposed to repeated invasions from the
North. Still as England could not subsist without
foreign commerce, and early became alive to that
great principle of her existence, a system of what
we may call navigation laws was established. The
bottoms of friendly powers were of course received
upon terms of reciprocal favour, but even strange
ships had the privilege of safety if they made certain
harbours, designated for that purpose. At the
treaty of Andover, in 994, Æðelræd and his witan
agreed, that every merchant-ship that voluntarily
came into port should be in the peace; and even
if it were driven into port (whether by force or by
stress of weather is not specified), and there were a
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">friðburh</span>, asylum, or building in the peace, in which
the men took refuge, they and their ship and cargo
should enjoy the peace<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c012'><sup>[180]</sup></a>. It is hardly to be doubted
that the king had the power of declaring what ports
should be gefriðod or in the peace; and as this privilege
would necessarily draw many advantages to
any harbour that possessed it, we can reasonably
conclude that it was made a source of profit, both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>by the king and those to whom he might think fit
to grant it.</p>

<p class='c011'>WARDSHIP and MARRIAGE.—Wardship and
Marriage appear to have been royalties; we must
however believe them to have been confined to the
children and widows of the thanes or comites, and
to be a deduction from the principles of the Comitatus
itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the secular law of Cnut there is a series of
provisions, extending from the 70th to the 75th
clause, which can only be looked upon in the light
of alleviations, and which in the 70th clause the
king himself declares so to be. From the nature
of the relief thus afforded, we may infer that the
royal officers had exercised their powers in a manner
oppressive to the subject. Accordingly the
king and his witan proceed to regulate the voluntary
nature of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>feormfultum</i></span>, the legal amount
of heriot, the descent of property in the case of intestacy,
and the kings’s guardianship of the same;
they protect the widow and heirs against vexatious
suits, by providing that they shall not be sued, if
the lord and father had remained undisturbed, and
lastly they regulate what appear to me to be the
rights of wardship and marriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And let every widow remain for a twelvemonth
without a husband; then let her do her pleasure.
But if within the year she choose a husband, let
her forfeit the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>morgengyfu</i></span> and all the property she
had through her first husband, and let her nearest
kin take the land and property she had before.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>And let the husband be liable in his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>wer</i></span> to the
king, or to whomsoever he may have granted it.
And even if she have been taken by force, let her
forfeit her possessions, unless she be willing to go
home again from the man, and never become his
again.... And let no one compel either woman
or maiden to him whom she herself mislikes, nor
for money sell her, unless the suitor will give something
of his own good will<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c012'><sup>[181]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This of itself does not imply the royal right of
marriage; but it becomes much more significant,
when we learn that estates had been given to influential
nobles, for their intercession with the king,
on behalf of profitable alliances: then, the circumstances,
combined together, seem to imply that
Cnut desired to reform the miserable condition in
which he found England, in the hope, no doubt,
by such reform to consolidate his own power. The
evidence of what may almost be called purchasing
a marriage—though not in the truly gross and vulgar
sense of such purchases among those whom
writers of romances represent as the <em>chivalrous</em>
Normans,—is supplied by the monk of Ramsey:
the instance dates from the middle of the tenth
century. In mentioning an estate of five hides at
Burwell, the chronicler adds: “This is the estate
which—as we find in the very ancient English
charters referring to it—a certain man named Eádwine,
the son of Othulf, had in old times granted
to archbishop Oda, as a reward for his pains and
trouble in bringing king Eádred to consent, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Eádwine might have leave to marry the daughter
of a certain Ulf, whom he desired<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c012'><sup>[182]</sup></a>.” This Ulf does
not, I believe, occur among the signitaries to any
of the charters, unless the name represent some
one of the many Wulfgárs or Wulfláf’s of the time:
but still we must suppose him to have been a person
of consideration, since a large estate was given
for his daughter’s marriage. In the absence of all
details we cannot form any clear decision as to the
royal right in this respect, though the balance of
probability seems to me to incline to the view that
the king had some right of wardship and marriage
over the children and widows of his own thanes or
sócmen. This seems to lie in the very nature of
their relative position. With the widow or child of
a free man, it is of course not to be imagined that
the king could interfere; but in the time of Eádred
there were probably not many free men whose
wealth rendered interference worth the trouble.</p>

<p class='c015'>HEREGEATWE. HERIOT.—The general nature
of Heriot has been explained in the First Book:
it was there shown that it arose from the theory of
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>comes</i></span> having been originally armed by the king,
to whom upon his death the arms reverted: and in
imitation of this, Best-head or Melius catallum, distinguished
in our law as Heriot-custom, was shown
to have arisen. But whatever may have been its
origin or early amount,—and its earliest amount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>was no doubt unsettled, depending upon the will
of the chief who might take all or some of his
thanes’ chattels at his pleasure,—in process of time
it became assessed at a fixed amount, according to
the rank of the person from whose estate it was
paid. The law of Cnut<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c012'><sup>[183]</sup></a> which determined this
amount was probably only a re-enactment, or confirmation
of an older custom, and appears to have
been introduced to put an end to disputes upon the
subject; it declares as follows:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let the heriots be as fits the degree. An earl’s
as belongs to an earl’s rank, viz. eight horses, four
saddled, four unsaddled, four helmets, four coats-of-mail,
eight spears, eight shields, four swords
and two hundred mancuses of gold. From a king’s
thane, of those who are nearest to him, four horses,
two saddled, two unsaddled; two swords, four
spears, four shields, a helmet, a coat-of-mail and
fifty mancuses of gold. From a medial thane, a
horse equipped, and his arms; or his healsfang in
Wessex, and in Mercia and Eastanglia two pounds.
Among the Danes, the heriot of a king’s thane who
has his sócn<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c012'><sup>[184]</sup></a> is four pounds: if he stand in nearer
relation to the king, two horses, one equipped, a
sword, two spears, two shields and fifty mancuses
of gold. And from a thane of the lower order, two
pounds.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The following are examples of heriots paid both
before and after the time of Cnut.</p>

<p class='c001'>The estate of Ðeódrǽd bishop of London and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Elmham, about 940, paid, four horses the best he
had, two swords the best he had, four shields, four
spears, two hundred marks of red gold, two silver
cups, and his lands at Anceswyrð, Illingtún and
Earmingtún<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c012'><sup>[185]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 946-956, the estate of Æðelwald the ealdorman
paid four horses, four spears, four swords, four
shields, two rings each worth one hundred and
twenty mancuses, two rings each worth eighty mancuses
(in all four hundred mancuses) and two silver
vessels<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c012'><sup>[186]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>About 958, Ælfgár gave the king two swords
with belts, three steeds, three shields, three spears,
and two rings each worth fifty mancuses of gold<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c012'><sup>[187]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The heriot of Beorhtríc, about 962, was, four
horses, two equipped, two swords and belts, a ring
worth eighty mancuses of gold, a sword of the
same value, two falcons, and all his stag-hounds<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c012'><sup>[188]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great duke Ælfheáh of Hampshire, 965-971,
gave to Eádgár, who had married his cousin Ælfðrýð,
duke Ordgár’s daughter, the following property:
it is hard to say how much of it was heriot:
six horses with their trappings, six swords, six
spears, six shields, one sword worth eighty mancuses
of gold, one dish of three pounds, one cup of
three pounds, three hundred mancuses of gold, one
hundred and twenty hides of land at Wyrð, and his
estates at Cóchám, Dæchám, Ceóleswyrð, Incgeneshám,
Æglesbyrig and Wendofra<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c012'><sup>[189]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Æðelríc, in 997, paid two horses, one sword
and belt, two shields, two spears, and sixty marks
of gold<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c012'><sup>[190]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Archbishop Ælfríc, 996-1006, devised to the
king, as his heriot, sixty helmets, sixty coats-of-mail,
and his best ship with all her tackle and
stores<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c012'><sup>[191]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ælfhelm paid four horses, two equipped, four
shields, four spears, two swords, and one hundred
mancuses of gold<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c012'><sup>[192]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wulfsige paid two horses, one helmet, one coat-of-mail,
one sword, one spear twined with gold<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c012'><sup>[193]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The majority of these cases belong to periods
previous to Cnut’s accession, but they seem to
imply an assessment very similar to his own. And
in this view of the case, where the payment had
become a settled amount due from persons of a particular
rank, it became possible for women to be
charged with it, which we accordingly find. In 1046
Wulfgýð commences her will by desiring that her
right heriot may be paid to the king<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c012'><sup>[194]</sup></a>: Æðelgyfu
in 945 gave the king thirty mancuses of gold,
two horses and all her dogs<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c012'><sup>[195]</sup></a>: Ælflǽd left him by
will her lands at Lamburnan, Ceólsige and Readingan,
four rings worth two hundred mancuses of
gold, four palls, four cups, four drinking-horns and
four horses<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c012'><sup>[196]</sup></a>: and lastly queen Ælfgyfu in 1012
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>left the king, six horses, six shields, six spears, one
cup, two rings worth one hundred and twenty mancuses
each, and various lands<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c012'><sup>[197]</sup></a>. Taken in connection
with the case of Wulfgýð, these bequests appear
very like heriots. The heriots mentioned in
Domesday agree with the details given above, and
serve to show that the right had undergone no
material alteration till the time of the Confessor<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c012'><sup>[198]</sup></a>.
That the Best-head or Melius catallum was paid to
the king by his unfree tenants, as well as to other
lords, is probable, but we have no instance of it<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c012'><sup>[199]</sup></a>.
By the law of Cnut, the widow was to have a reasonable
time for payment of the heriot, and it was
altogether remitted to the family of him who fell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>bravely fighting in the field before the presence of
his lord.</p>

<p class='c001'>It appears from what has been said in this chapter
that the kings were provided very sufficiently
with the means of maintaining their dignity: the
benefactions which they were enabled to make out
of the folcland relieved their private estates from
the burthen of supporting the thanes, clerical and
lay, who flocked to their service. Still there must
have been a constant drain upon their possessions;
and many of the regalia became lost to the crown
by successive alienations. It is true that they were
generally purchased at a high price, but in this
case the king who sold them was the only gainer:
he secured considerable sums for himself, but he
impoverished all his successors to a much greater
amount. The loans for which we occasionally find
him indebted to his prelates, show how completely
at times the crown had been pillaged, as well as
who were the principal sharers in the plunder. The
attempt to draw in lands and privileges which had
once been alienated, was questionable in policy and
harsh to the innocent holders; but it does not
always seem to have been viewed impartially even
by those least concerned; we may however now
express our conviction that in many cases the alienations
themselves had been made improperly and
without sufficient authority; and, that if it was
hard upon an abbot or bishop to lose what his predecessor
had gained, it was very hard upon a king
to be without what <em>his</em> predecessor had unjustly
and often illegally squandered.</p>

these are the technical terms throughout Europe. The king himself
took a corresponding oath to his people. We still have the words of

<p class='c001'>It is very uncertain at what time the custom of coronation, and
<em>unction</em>, by the hands of the clergy, commenced. The usurpation which
Pipin ventured and Pope Zachary lent himself to, which Charlemagne
repeated and Pope Leo confirmed, may have acted as a valuable precedent,
especially as the power of the King was sufficient to justify the
claim of the Pope. Thirty years later (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 787), the English bishops
put forward the somewhat bold claim to be, with the <em>seniores</em> populi,
electors of the king: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Duodecimo sermone sanximus; Ut in ordinatione
regum nullus permittat pravorum praevalere assensum; sed legitime
reges a sacerdotibus et senioribus populi eligantur, et non de
adulterio vel incoestu procreati; quia sicut nostris temporibus ad sacerdotium,
secundum Canones, adulter pervenire non potest, sic nec
Christus domini esse valet, et rex totius regni, et haeres patriae, qui ex
legitimo non fuerit connubio generatus.</span>” Conc. Calcuth. Legat. Spelm.
p. 296. No doubt from their position in the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena gemót</span>, and the
authority which they derived from their birth as well as station, they
always played an important part in the elections of kings, but not quite
so leading a part in the eighth century as they here attempt to claim.
The Diplomatarium Norwegicum supplies an interesting illustration of
the above-cited canon, in a dispensation issued by Pope Innocent IV.
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1246) to Haakon Haakonson, from the disqualification of illegitimate
birth: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum itaque clare memorie Haquinus, Norwegie rex
pater tuus, te, prout accepimus, solutus susceperit de soluta, nos tuam
celsitudinem speciali benevolentia prosequentes, ut huiusmodi non
obstante defectu ad regalis solii dignitatem et omnes actus legitimos
admittaris, nec non quod heredes tui legitimi tibi in dominio et honore
succedant, fratrum nostrorum communicato consilio, tecum auctoritate
apostolica dispensamus.</span>” No. 38, p. 30. This was not however considered
a valid ground of objection among the Anglosaxons, if the
personal qualities of the prince were such as to recommend him. From
the words used by William of Malmesbury we might infer that as late as
the time of Æðelstán, the functions of the bishops at the coronation were
confined to anathematizing those who would not be obedient subjects,
but that the nobles performed the actual coronation: he cites the following
lines from an earlier author, and one apparently contemporaneous
with Æðelstán himself:—</p>

perfectly obvious. Another difficulty arises from the word <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>stede</i></span>, which

The matter was brought into the king’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þeningmanna

But the defendant was not satisfied, and carried the cause to the shire,

diametrically opposite to that of the þeningmen or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ministri regii</i></span>.
It seems to have been a dirty business on the part of the bishop of
Rochester, and the freemen of Kent so treated it, in defiance of the
King’s Court. Cod. Dipl. No. 1258. The document is so important,
that it appears desirable to give it at full length. “Thus were the
lands at Bromley and Fawkham adjudged to king Eádgár in London,
through the charters of Snodland, which the priests stole from the
bishop of Rochester and secretly sold for money to Ælfric the son of
Æscwyn: and the same Æscwyn, Ælfric’s mother, had previously
granted them thither. Now when the bishop found the books were
stolen he made earnest demand for them. Meanwhile Ælfric died, and
he (the bishop) afterwards sued the widow so long that in the king’s
thanes-court the stolen books of Snodland were adjudged to him, and
damages for the theft, thereto; that was in London, and there were
present Eádgár the king, archbishop Dúnstán, bishop Æðelwold, bishop
Ælfstán and the other Ælfstán, Ælfhere the ealdorman and many
of the king’s witan: then they adjudged the books to the bishop for
his cathedral: so all the widow’s property stood in the king’s hand.
Then would Wulfstán the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> seize the property to the king’s hand,
both Bromley and Fawkham; but the widow sought the holy place and
the bishop, and surrendered to the king the charter of Bromley and
Fawkham: and the bishop bought the charters and the land of the
king at Godshill, for fifty mancuses of gold, and a hundred and thirty
pounds, through intercession and interest: afterwards the bishop permitted
the widow the usufruct of the land. During this time the king
died; and then Bryhtríc the widow’s relative began, and compelled her,
so that they took violent possession of the land [brúcon ðára landa on
reáfláce]. And they sought Eádwine the ealdorman, who was God’s
adversary, and the folk, and compelled the bishop to restore the books
on peril of all his property: he was not allowed to enjoy his rights in
any one of the three things which had been given him in pledge by all
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>leódscipe</i></span>, neither his plea, his succession, nor his ownership. This
is the witness of the purchase: Eádgár the king, Dunstan the archbishop,
Oswald the archbishop, bishop Æðelwold, bishop Æðelgar,
bishop Æscwig, bishop Ælfstán, the other bishop Ælfstán, bishop Sideman,
Ælfðrýð the king’s mother, Osgar the abbot, Ælfhere the ealdorman,
Wulfstan of Delham, Ælfric of Epsom, and the leading people
[dúgúð folces] of West Kent, where the land and lathe lie.” Here I
take it the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þeningmen</span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>servientes regis</i></span> and the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">leódscipe</span> (leudes) are
identical and opposed to the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Folc</i></span> who under “God’s adversary” Eádwine
made the bishop disgorge his plunder. We see who they were; Dunstan
and various bishops, ealdorman Ælfhere and several of the king’s
witan. This is the only instance I have been able to discover of anything
approaching to a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>curia regis</i></span> apart from the great <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena gemót</span>.
There are, no doubt, several cases where the king appears to have been
applied to in the first instance, by one of the parties; but in all of them
trial subsequently was had before the shiremoot. It is natural that
agreements should have been made by consent, before the king as arbitrator,
and these were probably frequent among his intimate councillors,

the litigation as a judgement of the courts would have done. Such arbitrements
were also made by the ealdorman, who like the king received
presents for his good offices. The advantage gained was this; both
parties were satisfied, without the danger of trying the suit, which entailed
very heavy penalties on the loser, amounting sometimes to total
forfeiture. The disadvantage was that there was no <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>ge-endodu spræc</i></span>
or finished plea, and consequently the award was sometimes violated,
when either party thought this could be done with impunity.</p>

It is well worth the consideration of our antiquarians who have devoted
pains and money to the opening of barrows, how far the notorious
searches which have been made for treasure in these repositories, by
successive generations of Saxons, Danes and Normans, may have interfered
with the <em>original</em> disposition of sepulchral mounds, cairns and

highest antiquity. “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Wæs ðǽr on ðám ealande sum hláw mycel ofer

rendered certain as to amount. In 814 Cénwulf released the Bishop

<p class='c001'>“This writing witnesseth how Harold the king caused Sandwich to
be ridden about to his own hand: and he kept it for himself well nigh
a twelvemonth, and at any rate fully two herring-seasons, all against
God’s will, and against the Saints’ who lie at Christchurch, as it turned
out ill enough for him afterwards. And during this time there went
Ælfstán the abbot of St. Augustine’s, and got, with his lying flatteries
and his gold and silver, all secretly from Steorra who was the king’s
redesman, a right to the third penny of the toll at Sandwich. Now when
archbishop Eádsige and all the brotherhood at Christchurch learnt this,
they took counsel together, that they should send Ælfgár, the monk of
Christchurch, to king Harold. Now the king lay at Oxford very ill,
so that his life was despaired of; and there were with him Lýfing, bishop
of Devonshire, and Tancred the monk. Then came the messenger
from Christchurch to the bishop; and he forth at once to the king,
and with him Ælfgár the monk, Osweard of Harrietsham, and Tancred;
and they told the king that he had deeply sinned against Christ,
in ever daring to take back anything from Christchurch which his predecessors
had given: and then they told him about Sandwich, how it
had been ridden about to his hand. There lay the king and turned
quite black in the face at their tale, and swore by God Almighty and
all his saints to boot, that it never was either his rede or his deed, that
Sandwich should be taken from Christchurch. So it was plain enough
that it was other peoples’ and not king Harold’s contrivance: and to
say the truth, Ælfstán the abbot’s counsel was with the men who
counselled it out of Christchurch. Then king Harold sent Ælfgár the
monk back to archbishop Eádsige and all the monks at Christchurch,
and gave them God’s greeting and his own, and commanded that they
should have Sandwich, into Christchurch, as fully and wholly as they
had ever had it in any king’s day, both in rent, in stream, on strand,
in fines, and in everything which any king had ever most fully possessed
before them. Now when abbot Ælfstán heard of this, he came
to archbishop Eádsige and begged his support with the brotherhood,
about the third penny: and away they both went to all the brotherhood
and begged the Convent that abbot Ælfstán might be allowed the
third penny of the toll, and he to give the Convent ten pounds. But
they refused it altogether throughout, and said it was no use asking:
and withal archbishop Eádsige backed him much more than he did
the Convent. And when he could not get on in this way, he asked
leave to make a wharf over against Mildðrýð’s acre, opposite the
ferry (?) to keep, but all the Convent decidedly refused this: and archbishop
Eádsige left it all to their own decision. Then abbot Ælfstán
set to, with a great help, and let dig a great canal at Hyppeles fleót,
hoping that craft would lie there, just as they did at Sandwich: however
he got no good by it; for he laboureth in vain who laboureth against
Christ’s will. So the abbot left it in this state, and the Convent took
to their own, in God’s witness, and Saint Mary’s, and all the Saints’
who rest at Christchurch and Saint Augustine’s. This is all true, believe
it who will: abbot Ælfstán never got the third penny at Sandwich
in any other way. God’s blessing be with us all now and for ever
more! Amen.”</p>

appears that those who were to purvey timber for the king, even as late
as the reign of James the First, used to extort money by the threat of
felling ornamental trees in the avenues or grounds of mansion-houses.

<p class='c001'><a href='#r174'>174</a>. It has already been noticed as remarkable that Pontifex, the bridge-builder,
should be the name for the priestly class. There are many superstitions
connected with bridges, and the spirit of the bridge even to
this day, in Germany, demands his victims as inexorably as the spirit
of the river. Deut. Mythol. p. 563. The passage in Schol. Ælii Aristid.
which speaks, according to a modern emendation, of Palladia in connection
with bridges, is hopelessly corrupt. But Servius, Æneid, ii. 661,
says the Athenian Pallas was called γεφυρῖτις (not γεφυρίστης as the
copies have), and this is confirmed by the Interp. Virgil, published by
Mai, where from her position on a bridge the goddess is called γεφυρῖτις
Ἀθηνᾶ. Pherecydes (No. 101) and Phylarchus (No. 79) both appear
to refer to this, if indeed the proposed readings can be admitted.
See Fragm. Hist. Græc. pp. 95, 356. There was in very early times a
<em>gens</em> of γεφυραῖοι at Athens, but I do not know if they had any priestly
functions. They had the worship of Δημήτηρ Ἄχαια, and were Cadmæans
who had immigrated into Attica; from among them sprung
Harmodius and Aristogeiton.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r175'>175</a>. Thierry, Lettres sur l’Hist. de France, p. 272. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ainsi élevés de la
triste condition de sujets taillables d’une abbaye au rang d’alliés politiques
d’un des plus puissants seigneurs, les habitans de Vézelay cherchèrent
à s’entourer des signes extérieurs qui annonçaient ce changement
d’état. Ils élevèrent autour de leurs maisons, chacun selon sa richesse,
des murailles crénelées, ce qui était alors la marque de la garantie
du privilége de liberté. L’un des plus considérables parmi eux,
nommé Simon, jeta les fondements d’une grosse tour carrée, comme
celle dont les restes se voient à Toulouse, à Arles, et dans plusieurs
villes d’Italie. Ces tours, auxquelles la tradition joint encore le nom
de leur premier possesseur, donnent une grande idée de l’importance
individuelle des riches bourgeois du moyen âge, importance bien autre
que la petite considération dont ils jouirent plus tard sous le régime
monarchique. Cet appareil seigneurial n’était pas, dans les grandes
villes de commune, le privilége exclusif d’un petit nombre d’hommes,
seuls puissants au milieu d’une multitude pauvre: Avignon, au commencement
du treizième siècle, ne comptait pas moins de trois cents
maisons garnies de tours.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>This last fact rests upon the authority of Matthew Paris. On the
defeat of the Commune, the order was given to raze their fortifications.
The king himself, Louis le Jeune (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1155), distinctly decreed in the
sentence which he pronounced against them, that within a given time
the towers, walls and enclosures with which they had fortified their
houses should be demolished. But the burghers had no such intention;
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ces signes de liberté leur étaient plus chers que leur argent;</span>”
and they continued to resist even after the Pope himself had written to
the king of France to demand the execution of the decree. At length
however the Abbot of Vézelay took the matter into his own hands. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il
fit venir, des domaines de son église, une troupe nombreuse de jeunes
paysans serfs, qu’il arma aussi bien qu’il put, et auxquels il donna pour
commandants les plus déterminés de ses moines. Cette troupe marcha
droit à la maison de Simon, et ne trouvant aucune résistance, se mit à
démolir la tour et les murailles crénelées, tandisque le maître de la
maison, calme et fier comme un Romain du temps de la république,
était assis au coin du feu avec sa femme et ses enfants. Ce succès, obtenu
sans combat, décida la victoire en faveur de la puissance seigneuriale,
et ceux d’entre les bourgeois qui avaient des maisons fortifiées
donnèrent à l’abbé des otages, pour garantie de la destruction de tous
leur ouvrages de défense. ‘Alors,’ dit le narrateur ecclésiastique, ‘toute
querelle fut terminée, et l’Abbaye de Vézelay recouvra le libre exercice
de son droit de juridiction sur ses vassaux rebelles.’</span>” Ibid. pp. 291,

  <h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER III. <br /> THE KING’S COURT AND HOUSEHOLD.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Anglosaxon Court appears to have been modelled
upon the same plan as that of the Frankish
Emperors: our documents do not however permit
us to judge whether this was the case before a
sufficient intercourse had taken place to render a
positive imitation probable.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not at all unlikely that, from the very first
establishment of the Comitatus, the possession of
those household offices was coveted, which brought
the holder into closer personal connection with the
prince: and more or less of dependence could be
of little moment with those who had erected into a
system the voluntary sacrifice of the holiest of all
possessions, their freedom of action. Hence we can
readily account for the assumption by men nobly
born of offices about the royal person, which were
at first directly and immediately menial<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c012'><sup>[200]</sup></a>. Nor,
as the opportunities of personal aggrandisement
through favouritism or affection were multiplied,
does it seem strange to us that these offices should
assume a character of dignity and real power, which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>however little in consonance with their original
intention, yet made them objects of ambition with
the wealthy and the noble. We do not any longer
wonder at the struggles of dukes and barons for
the offices of royal cupbearer at a coronation, or
Steward or Chamberlain of the Household, because
time and the attribution of judicial or administrative
functions have given those offices a distinction
which at the outset they did not possess: and we
see without surprise the electors of Germany personally
serving at his table the member of their
body whom they had invested with imperial rank;
and, when they fixed the throne hereditarily in him,
providing for the succession in their own families
of Butlers, Stewards, Marshals or Chancellors of
the empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the progress of society drew larger and larger
numbers of men into the circle of princely influence,
and, by withdrawing them from the jurisdiction
of the free courts, rendered a systematic establishment
of the Lord’s court more necessary, the
officers who were charged with the superintendence
of the various royal vassals, rose immeasurably in
the social scale. Thus the Major Domus or Mayor
of the palace, at first only a steward, who had to
regulate the affairs of the Household, gradually assumed
the management of those of the kingdom,
and ended by placing on his own head the crown
which he had filched from his master’s. So was it
with the rest.</p>

<p class='c001'>The four great officers of the Court and Household
in the oldest German kingdoms are the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Chamberlain, the Marshal, the Steward and the
Butler.</p>

<p class='c001'>The names by which the Chamberlain was designated
are Hrægel þegn, literally thane or servant
of the wardrobe, Cubicularius, Camerarius, Búrþegn,
perhaps sometimes Dispensator, and Thesaurarius
or Hordere. It is difficult to ascertain his
exact duties in the Anglosaxon Court, but they
probably differed little from those of the corresponding
officer among other German populations,
and there is reason to compare those of the Frankish
Cubicularius with the functions of the Comites
sacrarum largitionum and rerum privatarum of the
Roman emperors. Hence we may presume that he
had the general management of the royal property,
as well as the immediate regulation of the household<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c012'><sup>[201]</sup></a>.
In this capacity he may have been the recognized
chief of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cyninges túngeréfan</span> or king’s
bailiffs, on the several estates; for we find no traces
of any districtual or missatic authority to whom
these officers could account. At the same time it appears
that this officer was not what we now call the
Lord Great Chamberlain, but rather the Lord Chamberlain
of the Household, and that more than one
officer of the same rank existed at the same time<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c012'><sup>[202]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Hence we can hardly suppose that the dignity of the
office was comparable to that of the Lord Chamberlain
at present, with the great and various powers
and duties which are now committed to that distinguished
member of the Court. Among the nobles
who held this office I find the following named:—</p>

<p class='c015'>The Marshal (among the Franks Marescalcus, and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Comes stabuli</span>) was properly speaking the Master
of the Horse, and had charge of everything connected
with the royal equipments, in that department.
But as he gradually became the head of
the active and disposable military force of the palace,
he must be looked upon rather as the general
of the Household troops. It was thus that the
high military dignity of Constable, or Grand Marshal,
by degrees developed itself. This office was
held by nobles of the highest rank, and frequently
by several at once,—a sufficient explanation of a
fact which otherwise would appear strange, viz.
that we never find the royal power endangered by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>that of this influential minister. The Anglosaxon
titles are <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Steallere</span> and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Horsþegn</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stabulator</span> and

of the office before the close of the ninth century,
and it might therefore be imagined that it was
introduced into England after the establishment of
the family of Ecgberht had familiarized our countrymen
with the Frankish court and its customs,

probably include the arrangements for the general

<p class='c001'>In the year 946 Florence tells us of a dapifer
regis, whom he does not name. The queen and
princes of the blood had also a similar officer for the
management of their households. In 1060 we read
of Godwine, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">reginae dapifer</span><a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c012'><sup>[229]</sup></a>, and Æðelred’s son
Æðelstán had a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Discþegn</span> named Ælfmǽr<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c012'><sup>[230]</sup></a>. High
as this office was, we yet cannot expect to find in it
that overwhelming power wielded in later times by
the Seneschal or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dapifer Angliae</span>,—a power which
might easily have converted the Grandmesnils
and De Montforts into the Ebroins or Pepins of a
newly established dynasty, and after their fall was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>wisely retained in the royal family by our kings.
We have now, as is well known, only a Lord High
Steward, or Major domus, on particular occasions,
for which he is especially created: but the Lord
Steward of the Household is an officer of great
power and high dignity in the Court of our kings.
A Major domus regiae occurs, as far as I know, but
once in our Ante-Norman history, and may there
probably denote only the dapifer or seneschal: he
is mentioned by Florence, an. 1040, as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stir, major
domus ... magnae dignitatis vir</span>”; but we hear
nothing more of him, or of any such influence as the
corresponding high officer exercised in the Frankish
court. The title Regiae procurator aulae, borne by
the great Esgár, whom we have also seen among
the Marshals, may very likely only refer to his
office of dapifer<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c012'><sup>[231]</sup></a>, which, from the list given above,
it will be evident that he held.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last great officer is the Pincerna, in Germany
the Schenk or Buticularius,—the Butler. What his
particular duties were, beyond his personal service
at the royal board, and no doubt his general
superintendence of the royal cellars, we cannot
now discover; but the office was one of the highest
dignity, and was held by nobles of the loftiest
birth and greatest consideration. Óslác, a direct
descendant from the royal Jutish blood of Stuff and
Wihtgár, was the pincerna of king Æðelwulf; and
by this prince’s daughter, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">femina nobilis ingenio,
nobilis et genere,</span>”—his first wife Ósburh,—Æðelwulf
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>became the father of Ælfred<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c012'><sup>[232]</sup></a>. The Anglosaxon
name of this officer may have been Byrele,
or Scenca, but I am not aware of its occurrence.
The following are among the Pincernae mentioned.</p>

<p class='c015'>The queen, as she had a dapifer, had also a pincerna:
in 1062, Herdingus is reported to have held
that office<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c012'><sup>[238]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>There can be no doubt that these offices were
entirely Palatine or domestic, that is that they were
household dignities, and did not appertain to the
general administration. Only when the spirit and
feeling of the comitatus had completely prevailed
over the older free organization, did they rise into
an importance which, throughout the course of
mediæval history, we find continually on the increase.
They were the grades in the comitatus of
which Tacitus himself speaks, which depended
upon the good pleasure of the prince: and with
the power of the prince their power and dignity
varied. The functionaries who held them were the
heads of different departments to which belonged
all the vassals, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>leudes</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fideles</i></span> of the king: and as
by degrees the freemen perished away, and every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>one gladly rushed to throw himself into a state of
thaneship, the trusted and familiar friends of the
prince became the most powerful agents of his administration:
till the feudal system having seized
on everything, converted these court-functions also
into hereditary fiefs, and rendered their holders
often powerful enough to make head against the
authority of the crown itself. As long as a vestige
of the free constitution remained, we hear but little
of the court offices: what they became upon its
downfall is known to every reader of history. It
seems to me improbable that Godwine, or Harald,
or Leófríc or Sigeward should ever have filled
them: these men were ealdormen or dukes, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span>,
civil and military administrators; but not officers
of the royal household, powerful and dignified as
these might be. It is probable that the first and
most important of their duties was the administration
of justice to the king’s sócmen in their various
departments; from which in later times were clearly
derived the extensive powers and attributions of
the several royal courts: but as the intimate friends
and cherished counsellors of the king, they must
have possessed an influence whose natural tendency
was to complete that great change in the social
state, which causes of a more general nature,—increasing
population, commerce and the disturbance
of foreign and civil discord,—were hurrying relentlessly
onward.</p>

<p class='c001'>In various situations of trust and authority,
either by the side of these officers, or subordinated
to them, we find a number of other persons under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>different titles. Among these are the clergymen
who acted as clerks or notaries in the imperial
chancery. The Frankish court numbered among
its members a functionary of the highest rank, and
always a clergyman, from the very necessity of the
case, who went by the name of Apocrisiarius, Archicapellanus,
Capellanus<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c012'><sup>[239]</sup></a>, or at an earlier period,
of Referendarius<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c012'><sup>[240]</sup></a>; at a later again, of Archicancellarius,
because he had a subordinate officer or deputy
commonly called the Cancellarius. He was
the head of those whose business it was to prepare
writs and other legal instruments, and who went
by the general names of Notarii or Tabelliones<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c012'><sup>[241]</sup></a>.
In a state which admitted of what are now called
Personal laws, that is, where each man might be
judged, not according to the law of the place in
which he was settled, but that of his parents, that
under which he was born,—where Frank, Burgundian,
Alaman and Roman might claim each to be
tried and judged by Frankish, Burgundian, Alamanic
or Roman law respectively, whatever might be
the prevalent character of the territory in which he
was domiciled,—such an officer was indispensable.
The administration of the customary, unwritten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>law of the Teutonic tribes might have been left to
Teutonic officers; but what was to be done when
a Provincial claimed the application to his case
of the maxims and provisions of Roman jurisprudence?
What was to be done when a collision of
principles and a conflict of laws took place, and
must be provided for? A clergyman, whose own
nation, whatever it might be, merged in the Roman
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per clericalem honorem</i></span><a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c012'><sup>[242]</sup></a>, must necessarily become a
principal officer of a state which numbered both
Romans and clergymen among its subjects; and
hence the Apocrisiarius had a seat in the Carolingian
parliament<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c012'><sup>[243]</sup></a>, as well as in the Council of the
Household, and ultimately became the principal minister
for the affairs of the clergy<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c012'><sup>[244]</sup></a>. But no such
necessity existed in England, where there was no
system of conflicting laws, and where the use of
professional notaries was unknown<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c012'><sup>[245]</sup></a>, and I therefore
see no <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>à priori</i></span> probability of there having been any
such officer as the Referendarius or Apocrisiarius
in our courts. Nor till the reign of Eádweard the
Confessor is there the slightest historical evidence
in favour of such an office<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c012'><sup>[246]</sup></a>: under this prince
however, whose predilection for Norman customs is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>notorious, it is not improbable that some change
may have taken place in this respect, and that a
gradual approximation to the continental usage
may have been found. The occurrence therefore
of a Cancellarius, Sigillarius and Notarius among
his household does not appear matter of great surprise,
and may be admitted as genuine, if we are
only careful not to confound the first officer with
that great functionary whom we now call the Lord
High Chancellor of the realm. We are told that,
among his innovations, Eádweard attempted to introduce
the use of seals; the uniform tenor of his
writs certainly renders it not improbable that he had
also notaries or professional clerks, and I can therefore
admit the probability of his having appointed
some faithful chaplain to act as his chancellor, that
is, to keep his seal,—though not yet used for public
instruments,—and to manage the royal notarial establishment.
There are many persons named as royal
chaplains; some, whose successive appointments
to bishoprics appeared to our simple forefathers to
encroach too much upon the proper and canonical
mode of election. Among them are the following:—</p>

<p class='c001'>Eádweard’s queen Eádgyfu and her brother Harald
had also their chaplains; Walther, afterwards

in the same see<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c012'><sup>[265]</sup></a>, and who, being probably of the
same mind as his noble and warlike lord, was no
sooner a bishop than “he forsook his chrism and
rood, his spiritual weapons, and took to his spear
and sword,” and so going to the field against Griffin
the Welsh king, was slain, and many of his priests
with him. The establishment of chaplains in the
royal household is, of course, of the highest antiquity;
it is probable that they were preceded there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>by Pagan priests, and formed a necessary part of the
royal comitatus in all ages<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c012'><sup>[266]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the royal officers was also the Pedissequus
or as he is sometimes called Pedessessor, whose
functions I cannot nearer define, unless he were a
king’s messenger. The following instances occur:—Æðelheáh
pedessessor, who appears to have been
a duke<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c012'><sup>[267]</sup></a>: Bola pedisecus<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c012'><sup>[268]</sup></a>: Ælfred pedisecus<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c012'><sup>[269]</sup></a>.
Eástmund pedisecus<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c012'><sup>[270]</sup></a>. In Beówulf, Hunferð the
orator is said to <em>sit</em> at the king’s <em>feet</em>, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ðe æt

<p class='c001'>In the year 1040, Hardacnut’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>carnifex</i></span> or executioner
is described as a person of great dignity<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c012'><sup>[271]</sup></a>.
Other titles are also enumerated, some of which appear
to denote offices in the royal household: thus
we find Radulfus aulicus<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c012'><sup>[272]</sup></a>, Bundinus palatinus<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c012'><sup>[273]</sup></a>,

is uncertain whether the following are to be considered
as regular members of the court, or whether
their presence was merely accidental, on a particular
occasion: Brihtríc and Ælfgár, consiliarii<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c012'><sup>[279]</sup></a>,
Ælfwig<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c012'><sup>[280]</sup></a> and Cyneweard<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c012'><sup>[281]</sup></a> praepositi, Godricus tribunus<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c012'><sup>[282]</sup></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Aldred theloniarius<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c012'><sup>[283]</sup></a>. Nor is it absolutely
demonstrable that those who claimed consanguinity
with the king formed part of his household,
although they probably made their connexion valid
as a recommendation to royal favour. “The king’s
poor cousin<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c012'><sup>[284]</sup></a>” seems at all events to have taken care
that his light should shine before men, as we learn
from the signatures, Ælfhere ex parentela regis<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c012'><sup>[285]</sup></a>,
Leófwine propinquus regis<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c012'><sup>[286]</sup></a>, Hesburnus regis consanguineus<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c012'><sup>[287]</sup></a>,
Rodbertus regis consanguineus<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c012'><sup>[288]</sup></a>, and
similar entries.</p>

<p class='c001'>But no such doubt applies to the household
troops, or immediate body-guard of the king. These
are commonly called Húscarlas, by the Anglosaxon
writers, and continued to exist under that name
after the Norman conquest. Lappenberg has very
justly looked upon them as a kind of military gild,
or association, of which the king was the master<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c012'><sup>[289]</sup></a>.
I doubt whether they were organized as a separate
force before the time of Cnut; but it is certain that
under that prince and his Danish successors they
attained a definite and settled position. It is probable
that this resulted from the circumstances
under which he obtained the crown of England, and
that the institution was not known to his Saxon
predecessors: as an invader, not at all secure of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>tenure, and surrounded by nobles whose previous
conduct offered but slight guarantee of their fidelity,
it became absolutely necessary to his safety to
organize his own peculiar force in such a way as
to secure the readiest service if occasion demanded
it. This was the object of the Witherlags Ret, by
which the privileges and duties of the Húscarlas
were settled. Of this law Lappenberg observes:—“With
greater probability may be reckoned
among the earlier labours of Cnut, the composition
of the Witherlags Ret, a court- or gild-law, framed
for his standing army, as well as for the body-guards
of his jarls. As the greater part of his army remained
in England, the Witherlags Ret was there
first established, and as the introduction of strict
discipline among such a military community must
precede all other ameliorations in the condition of
the country, the mention of this law in its history
ought not to be omitted<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c012'><sup>[290]</sup></a>. The immediate military
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>attendants of a conqueror always exercise vast influence,
and these originally Danish soldiers (thingamenn,
thingamanna lith, by the English called
Húscarlas) have at a later period, both as bodyguards
of the king and of the great vassals, acted
no unimportant part in the country. They were
armed with axes, halberds and swords inlaid with
gold, and in purpose, descent and equipment corresponded
to the Warangian guard (Wæringer), in
which the throne of the Byzantine emperors found
its best security. In Cnut’s time the number of
these mercenaries was not very great,—being by
some reckoned at three thousand, by others at six
thousand<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c012'><sup>[291]</sup></a>—but they were gathered under his
banner from various nations, and consequently required
the stricter discipline. Even a valiant Wendish
prince, Gottschalk, the son of Udo, stayed long
with Cnut in England, and gained the hand of a
daughter of the royal house<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c012'><sup>[292]</sup></a>. Cnut himself appears
rather as a sort of grand-master of this military
gild, than as its commander, and it is said that,
having in his anger slain one of the brotherhood
in England, he submitted himself to its judgment
in their assembly (stefn) and paid a ninefold compensation<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c012'><sup>[293]</sup></a>.
The degrading epithet of ‘nithing’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>applied to an expelled member of the gild, is an
Anglosaxon word, which at a later period occurs
in a way to render it extremely probable that the
gild-law of the royal house-carls was in existence
after the Norman conquest<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c012'><sup>[294]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The details of this law are of the most stringent
description, regulating even the minutest points of
social intercourse. Its extreme punishment was
expulsion; but expulsion was nearly equivalent to
death, situated as the Húscarlas were expected to
be, among a hostile population. And though the
offending brother had his election, whether he
would retire from the gild by sea or land, yet the
circumstances which attended his ejection were
not those of mercy or alleviation. To the seashore,
the whole body of his ancient comrades were to
accompany him; then launching him in a boat,
with oars or sails, they were to commit him to his
fortune: henceforth he was not only a stranger but
an enemy, an outlaw: if stress of weather or other
accident brought him back to the shore, he might
be fallen upon and slain without remorse or retribution.
Or if he chose to retire by land, he was
to be led to the nearest wood, and there to be
watched till his form was lost in the darkness of
the thickets: three successive shouts were then to
be raised, to warn him of the direction in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>his gild-brothers lay in wait. If then, through the
devious error of the forest he returned into their
presence, his life was forfeit. To insult, injure or
dishonour a brother was an offence punished with
the utmost severity; and if three of the Húscarlas
concurred in accusing one of the body, there was
neither denial nor exculpation allowed; the penalty
followed inevitably. Such severe regulations as
these fully explain their object; and it seems to
have been successfully attained, for we are told
that, at least during the life of Cnut, the penalties
were never once incurred or enforced<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c012'><sup>[295]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the collocation of names among the witnesses
to a very important charter of 1052-1054,
we may infer that the Stealleras or Marshals were
the commanding officers of the Húscarlas<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c012'><sup>[296]</sup></a>. We
cannot doubt that they did really exercise an important
personal influence in England, although
they filled no recognized position under the law:
it is probable that they were reckoned as thanes or
ministers, as far as their wergyld and heriot were
concerned; but we have no evidence of this, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>should not dispute the assertion that from first to
last they had a law of their own,—a personal right,—that
they were not generally or originally landowners,
and that their institution was a modified
revival of the system of the Comitatus in its strictest
form. But upon these points we cannot decide.
It is very rarely that we find the Húscarlas acting
as witnesses to charters, which perhaps may lead
to the inference that they were not members of the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena gemót</span><a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c012'><sup>[297]</sup></a>: but in 1041 we are told that Hardacnut
sent two of his Húscarlas, Feader and Turstan,
to collect an unpopular tax, and that a sedition
was raised against them in Worcester, which
was not suppressed till the force of several counties,
under the most celebrated leaders of the day,
was brought against the city<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c012'><sup>[298]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a charter of the Confessor, we find the word
Húscarl translated by “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praefectus palatinus</span><a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c012'><sup>[299]</sup></a>,”—a
title which scarcely seems applicable to all the
members of a body numbering six, or even three,
thousand men: but, however this may be, we must
not confound these <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praefecti palatini</i></span> with the other,
earlier <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praefecti</i></span> who occur in Anglosaxon history<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c012'><sup>[300]</sup></a>:
these are clearly only <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span> or reeves, and have
nothing to do with the especial body of household
troops.</p>

<p class='c001'>It remains only to add that, in imitation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>king, the great nobles surrounded themselves with
a body-guard of Húscarlas<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c012'><sup>[301]</sup></a>, who probably stood in
the same relation to their lord, as he did to the
king: in short the institution is only a revival of
the Comitatus, described in the First Book, and
must have gone through a similar course of development.
Nay, the details which have reached us
of the later establishment may possibly throw light
upon the earlier, and serve to explain some of the
peculiarities which strike us in the account of Tacitus.
This difference indeed there is, that in the
later form the king and the comites unite in a definite
bond, with respective, stipulated rights; in the
earlier form, the comites attach themselves to the
king, without stipulation or reserve, although no
doubt under the protection of a customary and recognized,
although unwritten, law.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r290'>290</a>. This observation requires to be taken with some caution. The
Witherlags Ret was a private and bye-law, not a public law, and had
little to do with the public law, except in as far as it connected the
conquering force by closer bonds, and secured their energetic action as
a body, upon emergency. It was devised to keep the household troops
together, not to apply in any way to their public relation towards the
Saxons. Its influence was therefore only such as derived mediately
from the fact of its maintaining the king at the head of a select <em>prætorian</em>
cohort,—important occasionally, but always accidental. There
is no evidence that the great men of England, the Godwines, or Leófrics,
were ever Húscarlas, or that the leaders of this force were ever
Ealdormen or Geréfan. In fact it was the king’s “Army-club,” and
had neither constitutional place nor recognized power. The Húscarlas
were probably very like what the Mousquetaires and Gardes-de-corps
were in France before the first Revolution, and what the Lifeguards,
Leib-regimente, Guardia Real, and so on, have been in other states of
Europe; nor altogether unlike the Garde Impériale of Napoleon.</p>

the certainty that the struggle must be for life or death, formed a force

in a state which could only set on foot a clumsy and reluctant militia.
They were, in fact, nearly the only professional soldiers,—and as yet
there had been no Rocroy, Sempach or Morgarten.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER IV. <br /> THE EALDORMAN OR DUKE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is of much less importance to a people, what its
constitution is, than what is its administration;
nothing can be easier than to make what are called
charters, and it is a rhetorical commonplace to talk
of resting under a constitution, the growth of ages:
but no nation rests, or ever did rest, under the one
or the other. The source of a nation’s comfort,—of
its success in realizing the great principle of the
mutual guarantee of peace, lies in the administration
of what is called its constitution, in the skill
with which it has devised its machinery of government,
in the balance of power which it represents
in the election of its instruments. We shall therefore
pass now to the members of the Anglosaxon
administration.</p>

<p class='c001'>The dignity next in importance to the royal, is
that of the Ealdorman or Duke.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proper Anglosaxon name for this officer, as
ruler and leader of an army, is Heretoga, in Old-german
Herizohho, and in modern German, Herzog,—a
word compounded of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Here</i></span> an army, and
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>toga</i></span> a leader<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c012'><sup>[302]</sup></a>. It is in this sense only that Tacitus
appears to understand the word Dux, when he tells
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>us that dukes (i. e. generals) are chosen for their
valour, in contradistinction to kings, who are recommended
by their birth. But inasmuch as the
ducal functions in the Anglosaxon polity were by
no means confined to service in the field, the peculiar
title of Heretoga is very rarely met with, being
for the most part replaced by Ealdorman or Aldorman,
which denotes civil as well as military preeminence.
The word Heretoga accordingly is nowhere
found in the Saxon Chronicle, or in the Laws, except
in one late passage interpolated into the collection
called the Laws of Eádweard the Confessor, and
to the best of my remembrance it is found but once
in the Charters<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c012'><sup>[303]</sup></a>. From a very extensive and careful
comparison between the titles used in different
documents, it appears that Latin writers of various
periods, as Beda, the several compilers of Annals,
and the writers of charters, have used the words
Dux, Princeps and Comes, in a very arbitrary manner
to denote the holders of one and the same
office. It is indeed just possible that the grant of
peculiar and additional privileges may have been
supposed to make a distinction between the duke
and the prince, as the charters appear to show
something like a system of promotion at least
among the Mercian nobility, the same person being
found to sign for some time as dux, and afterwards
as princeps. In consequence of this confusion, it
is necessary to proceed with very great caution
the moment we leave contemporaneous history, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>become dependent upon the expressions of annalists
long subsequent to the events described: for strictly
and legally speaking, the words count, duke and
prince express very different ranks and functions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The pure Anglosaxon authorities however are
incapable of making any such blunder or falling
into any such confusion: where Simeon of Durham,
Florence of Worcester, Æðelweard, Henry
of Huntingdon, nay even Beda himself, use Consul,
Princeps, Dux and Comes, the Saxon Chronicle
and the charters composed in Saxon have invariably
Ealdorman. A few instances, down to the
time of Cnut, when a new organization, and with it
a new title, was adopted, will make this clear<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c012'><sup>[304]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>The word <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>ealdor</i></span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>aldor</i></span> in Anglosaxon denotes
princely dignity without any definition of function
whatever. In Beówulf it is used as a synonym for
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cyning</span>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þeóden</span> and other words applied to royal
personages. Like many other titles of rank in the
various Teutonic tongues, it is derived from an adjective
implying age, though practically this idea
does not by any means survive in it, any more than
it does in the word Senior, the origin of the feudal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>term Seigneur<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c012'><sup>[305]</sup></a>; and similarly the words “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ða
yldestan witan</span>,” literally the eldest councillors, are
used to express merely the most dignified<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c012'><sup>[306]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we compare the position and powers of the
ealdorman with those of the duke on the continent,
we shall find several points of difference which
deserve notice. In the imperial constitution of
the German states, as it was modified and settled
by Charlemagne, the duke was a superior officer
to the comes, count or graf, and a duchy for the
most part comprehended several counties, over
which the duke exercised an immediate jurisdiction<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c012'><sup>[307]</sup></a>.
Occasionally no doubt there were counties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>without duchies, and duchies without counties, that
is where the duke and count were the same person:
sometimes the dukes were hereditary dynasts,
representing sovereign families which had become
subject to the empire of the Franks, and who continued
to govern as imperial officers the populations
which either by conquest or alliance had
become incorporated with it; such were the dukes
in Bavaria and Swabia. In other cases they were
generals, exercising supreme military power over
extensive districts committed to their charge, and
mediately entrusted with the defence and government
of the Markgraviats or border-counties which
were established for the security of the frontiers.
The variable, and very frequently exceptional, position
of these nobles or ministerials, while it renders
it difficult to give an accurate description of their
powers which shall be applicable to all cases, often
accounts for the events by which we are led to recognize
modern kingdoms in the ancient duchies,
and to trace the derived and mediate authority
down to its establishment as independent royalty.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this state of things which was possible in an
empire comprising a vast extent of lands held by
tribes of different descent, language, and laws, and
often hostile to one another, was not to be expected
in a country like England. Neither were the districts
here sufficiently large, nor in general was the
national feeling in those districts sufficiently strong,
to produce similar results. Strictly speaking, during
what has been loosely termed the Heptarchy,
the various kingdoms or rather principal kingdoms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>bore a much greater resemblance to the Frankish
duchies, and the small subordinate principalities to
the counties; and could we admit the existence of
a central authority or Bretwaldadom, we should
find a considerable resemblance between the two
forms: but this is in fact impossible: the kings,
such as they were, continued to enjoy all the royal
rights in their limited districts; and the dukes remained
merely ministerial officers, of great dignity
indeed, but with well-defined and not very extensive
powers. The rebellion of a duke in English seems
nearly as rare as it is frequent in German history.
We may therefore conclude that the Anglosaxon
Ealdorman in reality represented the Graf or Count
of the Germans, before the powers of the latter had
been seriously abridged by the imperial constitution
of the Carlovings, by the growing authority of
the duke, the Missus or royal messenger and the
bishop. And this will tend to explain the comparatively
subordinate position of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>, who answers,
in little more than name, to the Graphio or
Graf.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Anglosaxon laws we find many provisions
respecting the powers and dignity of the ealdorman,
which it will be necessary to examine in detail. It
is highly probable that different races and kingdoms
adopted a somewhat different course with
respect to them,—a course rendered inevitable by
the connection of the ealdorman with territorial
government. The laws of the Kentish kings do
not make any mention of such an officer: the
ceorl, eorl and king are the only free classes whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>proportionable value they notice; and if there were
ealdormen at all, they were comprised in the great
caste of eorls or nobles by birth, even as Æðelberht’s
law uses <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>eorlcund</i></span>, that is of earl’s rank, as a synonym
for <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>betst</i></span>, that is the best or highest rank<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c012'><sup>[308]</sup></a>. In
the law of Eádríc and Hlóðhere, though various
judicial proceedings are referred to, we hear nothing
of the ealdorman: suit is to be prosecuted at
the king’s hall<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c012'><sup>[309]</sup></a>, before the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">stermelda</span><a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c012'><sup>[310]</sup></a>, or the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wícgeréfa</span><a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c012'><sup>[311]</sup></a>,
but no other officer is mentioned; probably
because at this period, the little kingdoms into
which Kent itself was divided, supplied ample machinery
for doing justice, without the establishment
of ealdormen for that or any other purpose. The
law of Wihtræd has no provision of the sort, and
it is remarkable that in the proem to his dooms,
which a king always declares to be made with the
counsel, consent and license of his nobles, the word
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>eádigan</i></span>, the wealthy or powerful, twice occurs<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c012'><sup>[312]</sup></a>,
but not the word <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>ealdormen</i></span>. I therefore think it
probable that Kent had no such officers at the commencement
of the eighth century<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c012'><sup>[313]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>In general Beda uses the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>tribunus</em></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praefectus</i></span>
to express the authority of a royal officer
either in the field or the city: with him <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>comes</i></span>
represents the old and proper sense of the king’s
comrade, as we find it in Tacitus, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dux</i></span> is applied
in the Roman sense to the leader or captain
of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>corps d’armée</i></span>. But it is possible that in one
passage he may have had something more in view,
where he states that after the death of Peada, that
is in 661, the dukes of the Mercians, Immin, Eaba
and Eádberht rebelled against Osuuiu of Northumberland
and raised Wulfhere to his father’s throne<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c012'><sup>[314]</sup></a>;
and he goes on to say that, having expelled the
princes,—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">principibus eiectis</span>,”—whom the foreign
king had imposed upon them, they recovered
both their boundaries and their liberty. It is
every way probable both that the Mercian dukes
and Northumbrian princes mentioned in this passage
were fiscal and administrative, not merely
military officers<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c012'><sup>[315]</sup></a>. Not much later than this we
find dukes in Wessex<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c012'><sup>[316]</sup></a> and Sussex<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c012'><sup>[317]</sup></a>; and from this
period we can follow the dukes with little intermission
till the close of the genuine Anglosaxon
rule with Eádmund Irensída.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the time of Ini of Wessex we have the
means of tracing the institution with some certainty;
and we may thus commence our enquiry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>with the first years of the eighth century, nearly
one hundred years before Charlemagne modified
and recast the German empire. At first the ealdormen
are few in number, but increase as the circuit
of the kingdom extends; we can thus follow
them in connection with the political advance of
the several countries, till we find at one time no
less than three dukes at once in Kent, and sixteen
in Mercia. This number attended a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span>
held by Coenwulf in the year 814.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reason of this was, that the ealdorman was
inseparable from a shire or gá: the territorial and
political divisions went together, and as conquest
increased or defeat diminished the number of shires
comprised in a kingdom, we find a corresponding
increase or diminution in the number of dukes
attendant upon the king. Ælfred decides that if
a man wish to leave one lord and seek another,
(hláfordsócn, a right possessed by all freemen,)
he is to do so with the witness of the ealdorman
whom he before followed in his shire, that is, whose
court and military muster he had been bound to
attend<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c012'><sup>[318]</sup></a>: and Ini declares that the ealdorman who
shall be privy to the escape of a thief shall forfeit
his shire, unless he can obtain the king’s pardon<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c012'><sup>[319]</sup></a>.
The proportionably great severity of this punishment
arises, and most justly so, from the circumstance
of the ealdorman being the principal judicial
officer in the county, as the Graf was among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Franks. The fiftieth law of Ini provides for the
case where a man compounds for offences committed
by any of his household, where suit has
been either made before the king-himself or the
king’s ealdorman<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c012'><sup>[320]</sup></a>. He was commanded to hold a
shiremoot or general county-court twice in the year,
where in company of the bishop lie was to superintend
the administration of civil, criminal and ecclesiastical
law: Eádgár enacts<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c012'><sup>[321]</sup></a>,—“Twice in the
year be a shiremoot held; and let both the bishop
of the shire and the ealdorman be present, and there
expound both the law of God, and of the world:”
which enactment is repeated in nearly the same
words by Cnut<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c012'><sup>[322]</sup></a>. And this is consistent with a
regulation of Ælfred, by which a heavy fine is inflicted
upon him who shall break the public peace
by fighting or even drawing his weapon in the Folcmoot
before the king’s ealdorman<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c012'><sup>[323]</sup></a>. In the year 780
we learn from the Saxon Chronicle that the high-reeves
or noble <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span> of Northumberland burned
Beorn the ealdorman to death at Seletún<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c012'><sup>[324]</sup></a>: but
Henry of Huntingdon records the same fact with
more detail: he says<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c012'><sup>[325]</sup></a>,—“The year after this the
princes and chief officers of Northumberland burned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>to death a certain <em>consul</em> and justiciary of theirs,
because he was more severe than was right:” from
which it would appear not only that this ealdorman
had been guilty of cruelty and oppression in the exercise
of his judicial functions, but, from the hint of
Simeon, also that the king acquiesced in his punishment.
We have occasional records in the Saxon
charters which show that the shiremoot for judicial
purposes was presided over by the ealdorman of
the shire. In 825 there was an interesting trial
touching the rights of pasture belonging to Worcester
cathedral, which the public officers had encroached
upon: it was arranged in a synod held
at Clofeshoo, that the bishop should give security
to the ealdorman and witan of the county, to make
good his claim on oath, which was done within a
month at Worcester, in the presence of Háma the
woodreeve, who attended on behalf of Eádwulf the
ealdorman<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c012'><sup>[326]</sup></a>. Another very important document records
a trial which took place about 1038 in Herefordshire:
the shiremoot sat at Ægelnóðes stán, and
was held by Æðelstán the bishop, and Ranig the
ealdorman in the presence of the county thanes<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c012'><sup>[327]</sup></a>.
Another but undated record of a shiremoot held at
Worcester again presents us with the presidency
of an ealdorman, Leófwine<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c012'><sup>[328]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is thus clear that the ealdorman really stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>at the head of the justice of the county, and for
this purpose there can be no doubt that he possessed
full power of holding plea, and proceeding
to execution both in civil and criminal cases. The
scírmen, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfan</span> or sheriffs were his officers,
and acted by his authority, a point to which I
shall return hereafter. That the executive as well
as the judicial authority resided in the ealdorman
and his officers seems to me unquestionable: Ælfred
directs that no private feud shall be permitted,
except in certain grave cases, but that if a man
beleaguers his foe in his own house, he shall summon
him to surrender his weapons and stand to
trial. If the complainant be not powerful enough
to enforce this, he is to apply to the ealdorman (a
mode of expression which implies the presence of
one in every shire), and on his refusal to assist, resort
may be had to the king<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c012'><sup>[329]</sup></a>. For this there was
also good reason: the ealdorman in the shire, like
the Frankish graf, was the military leader of the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>hereban</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse comitatus</span> or levy <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en masse</em></span> of the
freemen, and as such could command their services
to repel invasion or to exercise the functions of the
higher police: as a noble of the first rank he had
armed retainers, thanes or comites of his own; but
his most important functions were as leader of the
armed force of the shire. Throughout the Saxon
times we read of ealdormen at the head of particular
counties, doing service in the field: thus in 800
we hear of a battle between the Mercian ealdorman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Æðelmund with the Hwiccas, and the Westsaxon
Weoxstán with the men of Wiltshire<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c012'><sup>[330]</sup></a>: in 837,
Æðelhelm led the men of Dorset against the Danes<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c012'><sup>[331]</sup></a>:
in 845 Eánwulf with the men of Somerset, and Osríc
with the men of Dorset, obtained a bloody victory
over the same adversaries<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c012'><sup>[332]</sup></a>: in 853 a similar
fortune attended Ealhhere with the men of Kent,
and IIuda with them of Surrey, the latter of whom
had marched from their own county into Thanet,
in pursuit of the enemy<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c012'><sup>[333]</sup></a>. In 860, Osríc with his
men of Hampshire, and ealdorman Æðelwulf with
the power of Berkshire, gave the Danes an overthrow
in the neighbourhood of Winchester<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c012'><sup>[334]</sup></a>; in
905 the men of Kent with Sigewulf and Sigehelm
their ealdormen were defeated on the banks of the
Ouse<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c012'><sup>[335]</sup></a>: lastly in 1016, we find Eádríc the ealdorman
deserting Eádmund Irensída in battle with the
Magesætan or people of Herefordshire<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c012'><sup>[336]</sup></a>,—a treason
which ultimately led to the division of England
between Eádmund and Cnut, and later to the monarchy
of the latter. Everywhere the ealdorman
is identified with the military force of his shire or
county, as we have already seen that he was with
the administration of justice.</p>

<p class='c001'>The internal regulation of the shire, as well as
its political relation to the whole kingdom, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>under the immediate guidance and supervision of
the ealdorman: the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span> or sheriff was little
more than his deputy: it is not to be doubted that
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cyninges geréfan</span>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wícgeréfan</span> and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">túngeréfan</span>
were under his superintendence and command, and
it would almost appear as if he possessed the right
to appoint as well as control these officers: at all
events we find some of them intended by the expression
“<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ðæs ealdormonnes gingran,</span>” literally the
ealdorman’s subordinate officers; Ælfred having
affixed a severe punishment to the offence of breaking
the peace of the folcmoot, in the ealdorman’s
presence, continues: “If anything of this sort happen
before a king’s ealdorman’s subordinate officer,
or a king’s priest, let the fine be thirty shillings<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c012'><sup>[337]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the year 995 certain brothers, apparently persons
of some consideration, having been involved
in an accusation of theft, a tumultuary affray took
place, in which, amongst others, they were slain:
the king’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wícgeréfan</span> in Oxford and Buckingham
permitted their bodies to be laid in consecrated
ground: but the ealdorman of the district, on being
apprised of the facts, attempted to reverse the
judgment of the wic-reeves<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c012'><sup>[338]</sup></a>. It would therefore
appear that these officers were subordinated to his
authority. The analogy which we everywhere trace
between the ealdorman and the graf, induces the
conclusion that the former was the head fiscal
officer of the shire; and that, in this as in all other
cases, the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span>was his officer and accounted
to him.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>The means by which his dignity was supported
were, strictly speaking, supplied by the state: they
consisted in the first place of lands within his district<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c012'><sup>[339]</sup></a>,
which appear to have passed with the office,
and consequently to have been inalienable by any
particular holder: but he also derived a considerable
income from the fines and other moneys levied to
the king’s use, his share of which probably amounted
to one-third<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c012'><sup>[340]</sup></a>. But as it invariably happened that
the ealdorman was appointed from among the class
of higher nobles, it is certain that he always possessed
large landed estates of his own<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c012'><sup>[341]</sup></a>, either by
inheritance or royal grant: moreover it is probable
that among a people in that stage of society in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>which we find the Saxons, voluntary offerings to
no small amount would find their way into the
spence or treasury of so powerful an officer: no
one ever approaches a Pacha without a present.
One form of such gratuities we can trace in the
charters; I mean the grant of estates either for
lives or perpetuity, made by the clergy in consideration
of support and protection; thus in 855, we
find that Ealhhun, bishop of Worcester, and his
chapter gave eleven hides of land to duke Æðelwulf
and Wulfðrýð, his duchess, for their lives, on condition
that he would be a good and true friend
to the monastery, and protector of its liberties<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c012'><sup>[342]</sup></a>.
Fifty years later, in 904, Werfrið and the same
chapter granted to duke Æðelred, his duchess and
their daughter, a vill in Worcester and about 132
acres of arable and meadow land, for three lives,
with reversion to the see, on condition that they
would be good friends and protectors to the chapter<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c012'><sup>[343]</sup></a>.
It is likewise probable that even if no settled,
legal share of the plunder were his of right,
still his opportunities of enriching himself in his
capacity of general were not inconsiderable: he
must for instance have had the ransom of all prisoners
of any distinction, or the price of their sale.
And lastly in his public capacity he must always
have had a sufficient supply of convict as well
as voluntary labour at command, to ensure the
profitable cultivation of his land, and the safe
keeping of his flocks and herds. There cannot be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the slightest doubt that he also possessed all the
regalia in his own lands whether public or private,
and that thus, wreck, treasure-trove, fines for harbouring
of outlaws, and many other bóts or legal
amerciaments passed into his hands. There are
even slight indications that he, like many of the
bishops, possessed the right to coin money; and in
every case, he must have had the superintendence
of the royal mint, and therefore probably the forfeiture
of all unlicensed moneyers. In addition to
all this, we cannot doubt that his power and influence
pointed him out as the lord who could best be
relied upon for protection and favour; and we may
therefore conclude that commendation of estates
to him was not unusual, from all which estates he
would receive not only recognitory services, and
yearly <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gafol</i></span> or rent in labour and produce, but in
all probability also fines on demise or alienation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the position which his nobility, his power
and his wealth secured to the ealdorman was a
brilliant one. In fact the whole executive government
may be considered as a great aristocratical
association, of which the ealdormen were the constituent
members, and the king little more than the
president. They were in nearly every respect his
equals, and possessed the right of intermarriage
with him<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c012'><sup>[344]</sup></a>: it was solely with their consent that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>he could be elected or appointed to the crown, and
by their support, co-operation and alliance that he
was maintained there. Without their concurrence
and assent, their license and permission, he could not
make, abrogate or alter laws: they were the principal
witan or counsellors, the leaders of the great
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> or national inquest, the guardians, upholders
and regulators of that aristocratical power of which
he was the ultimate representative and head. The
wergyld and oath of an ealdorman were in proportion
to this lofty position: at first no doubt, he
ranked only with the general class of nobles in this
respect, and the Kentish law does not distinguish
him from them: but at a later period, when the
aristocratical hierarchy had somewhat better developed
itself, we find him rated on the same level
with the bishop, and above the ordinary nobles.
From the chapter concerning wergylds<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c012'><sup>[345]</sup></a>, we find
that the Northumbrian law rated the ealdorman at
something more than thirty times the value of the
ceorl, while in Mercia we hear only of thanes or
twelve-hynde men, worth six times the ceorl or two-hynde
man: and in Kent the eorl seems to have
exceeded the ceorl by three times only.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the value of the wergyld was not the only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>measure of the ealdorman’s dignity. His oath bore
the same proportion to that of the ceorl, and I
think we may assume that this relative proportion
was maintained throughout all ranks. The law respecting
oaths declares that the oath of a twelve-hynde
shall be equal to those of six ceorlas, because
if one would avenge a twelve-hynde it can be fully
done upon six ceorlas, and his wergyld is equal to
their six<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c012'><sup>[346]</sup></a>. His house was in some sort a sanctuary,
and any wrong-doer who fled to it had three days’
respite<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c012'><sup>[347]</sup></a>; if any one broke the peace therein, he
was liable to a heavy fine<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c012'><sup>[348]</sup></a>; his burhbryce, or the
mulct for violation of his castle, was eighty shillings<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c012'><sup>[349]</sup></a>,
which however the law of Ælfred reduces
to sixty<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c012'><sup>[350]</sup></a>; for a breach of his borh or surety, and
his mundbyrd or protection, a fine of two pounds
was imposed<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c012'><sup>[351]</sup></a>; his Fihtwíte, or the penalty imposed
upon the man who drew sword and fought
in his presence, was one hundred shillings<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c012'><sup>[352]</sup></a>, which
was increased to one hundred and twenty if the offence
was committed in the open court of justice<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c012'><sup>[353]</sup></a>.
The only person who enjoys a higher state, beside
the king, is the archbishop; and this pre-eminence
may probably have once been due to the heathen
high-priest; just as, indeed, the equality of the
bishop and ealdorman may have been traditionally
handed down from a period when the priesthood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>and the highest nobility formed one body. There
is no very distinct intimation of any peculiar dress
or decoration by which the ealdorman was distinguished,
but he probably wore a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">beáh</span> or ring upon
his head, the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">fetel</span> or embroidered belt, and the
golden hilt which seems to have been peculiar to
the noble class. The staff and sword were probably
borne by him as symbols of his civil and
criminal jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c001'>The method then by which this rank was attained
becomes of some interest. And first it is necessary
to inquire whether it was hereditary or not;
whether it was for life, or only <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>durante beneplacito</i></span>,
or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>benemerito</i></span>. That it was not strictly hereditary
appears in the clearest manner from the general
fact that the appointments recorded in the Chronicle
and elsewhere are given to nobles unconnected
by blood with the last ealdorman. There are very
few instances of an ealdorman’s rank being held in
the same county by a father and son in succession.
This occurred indeed in Mercia, where in 983 Ælfríc
succeeded his father Ælfhere: Harald followed
Godwine in his duchy, and at the same period,
Leófríc and Sigeweard succeeded in establishing a
sort of succession in their families. But when this
did take place, it must be looked upon as a departure
from the old principle, and as a thing which in
practice would have been carefully avoided, during
the better period of Anglosaxon history, for which
the feeble reign of Æðelred offers no fair pattern.
Under his weak and miserable rule the more powerful
nobles might venture upon usurpations which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>would have been impossible under his father. And
Cnut’s system of administration was favourable to
the growth of an hereditary order of dukes. A
further examination of our history shows that in
general the dignity was held for life; we very rarely,
if ever, hear of an ealdorman removed or promoted
from one shire to another, and the entries in the
Chronicle as well as the signatures to the charters
attest that many of their number enjoyed their dignity
for a very large number of years, in spite of
the chances of an active military life. But we do
find, and not unfrequently, that ealdormen have
been expelled from their offices for treason and
other grave offences. In the later times of Æðelred,
when traitorous dealings with the Danish enemy
offered the means of serving private or family hostility,
the outlawry of the ealdorman who led the
different conflicting parties in the state was common,
and similar events accompanied the struggles
of Godwine’s party against the family of Mercia,
for the conduct of public affairs in England<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c012'><sup>[354]</sup></a>. But
at a much earlier period we hear of ealdormen
losing their offices and lands: in 901, Eádweard
gave to Winchester ten hides at Wiley, which duke
Wulfhere had forfeited by leaving his king and
country without licence<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c012'><sup>[355]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>But if the dignity of ealdorman did not descend
by regular succession, are we to conclude that
it was attained by popular election? Such is
the doctrine of the laws commonly attributed to
Eádweard the Confessor. In these we are thus
told:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“There were also other authorities and dignities
established throughout all the provinces and countries,
and separate counties of the whole realm
aforesaid, which among the Angles were called
Heretoches, being to wit, barons, noble, of distinguished
wisdom, fidelity and courage: but in Latin
these were called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ductores exercitus</i></span>, leaders of the
army, and among the Gauls, Capital Constables, or
Marshals of the army. They had the ordering of
numerous armies in battle, and placed the wings
as was most fitting, and to them seemed most conducive
to the honour of the crown and the utility
of the realm. Now these men were elected by
common counsel for the general weal, throughout
all the provinces and countries, and the several
counties, in full folkmote, as the sheriffs of the
provinces and counties ought also to be elected: so
that in every county there was one heretoch elected
to lead the array of his county, according to the
precept of our lord the king, to the honour and advantage
of the crown of the realm aforesaid, whenever
need should be in the realm<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c012'><sup>[356]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To this doctrine I deeply regret that I cannot
subscribe. Whatever remembrance of the earliest
periods and their traditions may have lurked in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>the mind of the writer, I am compelled to say that
his description is not applicable to any period comprehended
in authoritative history. A real election
of a duke or ealdorman by the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">folcmót</span> may have
been known to the Germans of Tacitus, but I fear
not to those who two centuries later established
themselves in England. There cannot, I imagine,
be the slightest doubt that the ealdormen of the
several districts were appointed by the crown, with
the assent of the higher nobles, if not of the whole
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span>. But it is also probable that in the
strict theory of their appointment, the consent of
the county was assumed to be necessary; and it is
possible that, on the return of the newly appointed
ealdorman to his shire, he was regularly received,
installed and inaugurated by acclamation of the
shire-thanes, and the oath of office administered in
the shiremoot, whose co-operation and assent in his
election was thus represented. Whatever may have
been his original character, it seems certain that
at no time later than the fifth century could the
ealdorman have been the people’s officer, but on
the contrary that he was always the officer of that
aristocratical association of which the king was the
head<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c012'><sup>[357]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still I do not think that in general the choice
of the witan could be a capricious or an unconditional
one. There must have been in every shire certain
powerful families from whose members alone
the selection could be made; the instincts of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>aristocracies, as well as the analogy of other great
Anglosaxon dignities, render it certain that the
ealdormannic families, as a general rule, retained
this office among themselves, although the particular
one from which the officer should at any given
time be taken were left undecided, for the determination
of the Witan. It was almost necessary
policy to place at the head of the county one of
the most highly connected, trustworthy, powerful
and wealthy of its nobles,—less necessary, however
usual, <em>now</em> than then, when the functions of the
Lord Lieutenant and the High Sheriff were united
in the same person. It even appears probable, although
the difficulty of tracing the Anglosaxon pedigrees
prevents our asserting it as a positive fact,
that the ducal families were in direct descent from
the old regal families, which became mediatized, to
use a modern term, upon the rise of their more
fortunate compeers. We know this to have been
the case with Æðelred, duke and viceroy of Mercia
under Ælfred and Eádweard. In the ninth century
we find Oswulf, ealdorman of East Kent, calling
himself “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dei gratia dux;</span>” and Sigewulf and
Sigehelm, who appear in the tenth also among the
dukes of Kent, were very probably descendants of
Sigeræd, a king of that province.</p>

<p class='c001'>The new Constitution introduced by Cnut reduced
the ealdorman to a subordinate position:
over several counties was now placed one eorl, or
earl, in the northern sense a jarl, with power analogous
to that of the Frankish dukes. The word
ealdorman itself was used by the Danes to denote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>a class, gentle indeed, but very inferior to the
princely officers who had previously borne that
title: it is under Cnut, and the following Danish
kings that we gradually lose sight of the old ealdormen;
the king rules by his earls and his Húscarlas,
and the ealdormen vanish from the counties. From
this time the king’s writs are directed to the earl,
the bishop and the sheriff of the county, but in
no one of them does the title of the ealdorman
any longer occur; while those sent to the towns
are directed to the bishop and the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">portgeréfa</span> or
præfect of the city. Gradually the old title ceases
altogether except in the cities, where it denotes an
inferior judicature, much as it does among ourselves
at the present day.</p>

Whether all the estates of folcland were charged with payments to the
duke is uncertain, but yet this is probable. The monastery lands appear
to have been so; for in 848 Hunberht, ealdorman, prince or duke
of the Tonsetan, released the monastery of Bredon from all payments
heretofore due from that monastery to himself, or generally to the
princes of that district. Cod. Dipl. No. 261. Again in 836, Wigláf
of Mercia granted to the monastery at Hanbury perfect freedom and exemption
from all demands, known and unknown, save the three inevitable
burthens: the ealdormen Sigered and Mucel, whose rights
were thus diminished, were indemnified, the first with a purse of six
hundred shillings in gold, the second with three hundred acres at
Croglea. Cod. Dipl. No. 237.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f341'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r341'>341</a>. The highest rank, that is the ealdorman’s, appears to have implied
the absolute possession of land to the amount of 40 hides, or 1200
acres. See Hist. Eliens. ii. 40: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed quoniam ille 40 hidarum terrae
dominium minime obtineret, licet nobilis esset, inter proceres tunc nominari
non potuit,</span>” etc. The charters show what large estates were
devised by many of these ealdormen.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f344'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r344'>344</a>. This would follow from their original nobility, which made them
of equal birth with the king: but there is a case which seems to show
that the rank itself of ealdorman sufficed to give this privilege. Eádríc
ealdorman of Mercia, who is said to have been of low extraction, married
a sister of Cnut; and Eádweard the Confessor had a daughter
of earl Godwine to wife. The other case was common: “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">And Æðelflǽd æt Domerhamme, Ælfgáres dohtor ealdormannes, wæs ðá his
cwen,</span>” <i>i. e.</i> Eádmund’s. Chron. Sax. an. 946. “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Eádgár cyning genam

found husbands on the continent.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER V. <br /> THE GERÉFA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The most general name for the fiscal, administrative
and executive officer among the Anglosaxons
was <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Geréfa</span>, or as it is written in very early documents
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geróefa</span><a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c012'><sup>[358]</sup></a>: but the peculiar functions of the
individuals comprehended under it, were further
defined by a prefix compounded with it, as <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span>,
the reeve of the shire or sheriff: <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">túngeréfa</span>
the reeve of the farm or bailiff. The exact meaning
and etymology of this name have hitherto
eluded the researches of our best scholars, and yet
perhaps few words have been more zealously investigated<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c012'><sup>[359]</sup></a>:
if I add another to the number of attempts
to solve the riddle, it is only because I believe
the force of the word will become much more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>evident when we have settled its genuine derivation;
and that philology has yet a part to play in
history which has not been duly recognized. One
of the oldest and most popular opinions was that
which connected the name with words denoting
seniority; thus, with the German adjective <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>grau</em></span>,
Anglosaxon <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>grǽg</i></span>, grey. There was however little
resemblance between <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">grǽg</span>, the Anglosaxon
forms, and the whole of this theory was
applicable only to the Latino-Frankish form <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">graphio</span>,
or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gravio</span>. The frequent use of words denoting
advanced age, as titles of honour,—among
which ealdor <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>princeps</i></span>, senior <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>seigneur</em></span>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ða yldestan</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>primates</i></span>, and many others, will readily occur to
the reader,—favoured this opinion, which was long
maintained: but especially in Germany, it has
been entirely exploded by Grimm in his <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Rechtsalterthümer</span><a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c012'><sup>[360]</sup></a>,
and proof adduced that there cannot
be the <a id='corr152.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='slighest'>slightest</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_152.19'><ins class='correction' title='slighest'>slightest</ins></a></span> connection between <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>graf</em></span> and
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>grau</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>More plausibility lay in the etymology of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>
adopted by Spelman; this rested upon the assumption
that <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> was equivalent to <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gereáfa</span>, and that
it was derived from <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">reáfan</span>, to plunder; this view
was strengthened by the circumstance of the word
being frequently translated by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>exactor</i></span>, the levying
of fines and the like being a characteristic part of
a reeve’s duties. But this view is unquestionably
erroneous: in the first place <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> could not have
been universally substituted for the more accurate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>g<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gereáfa</span>, which last word never occurs, any more
than on the other hand does <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">réfan</span> for <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">reáfan</span>. Secondly,
an Anglosaxon <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>, if for <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gereáfa</span>, would
necessarily imply a High-dutch garaupjo, a word
which we not only do not find, but which bears no
sort of resemblance to krávo and grávo which we
do find<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c012'><sup>[361]</sup></a>. Lambarde’s derivation of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> from <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gereccan</span>,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>regere</em></span>, may be consigned to the same storehouse
of blunders as Lipsius’s <em>graf</em> from γράφειν.
Again, as words compounded with <em>ge-</em> and ending
in <em>-a</em>, often denote a person who participates with
others in something expressed by the root, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>
has been explained to be one who shares in the
roof, <i>i. e.</i> the kings roof: and this has been supported
by the fact that graf is equivalent to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>comes</i></span>,
and that at an early period the comites are found
occupying the places of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span>. But a fatal objection
to this etymon lies in the omission of the <i>h</i>
from <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>, which would not have been the case
had hróf really been the root. Grimm says, “I will
venture another supposition. In old High-dutch
rávo meant <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tignum</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tectum</i></span> (Old Norse rǽfr, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tectum</i></span>),
perhaps also <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>domus</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>aula</i></span>; garávjo, girávjo, girávo,
would thus mean <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>comes</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>socius</i></span>, like gistallo, and
gisaljo, gisello (Gram. ii. 736)<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c012'><sup>[362]</sup></a>.” There is however
a serious objection to this hypothesis: were
it admitted, the Anglosaxon word must have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gerǽfa</span>, not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">geréfa</span> for <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">geróefa</span>, that is, the vowel in
the root must have been a long ǽ, not a long é,
springing out of and representing a long ó. I am
naturally very diffident of my own opinion in a case
of so much obscurity, and where many profound
thinkers have failed of success; still it seems to me
that <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> may possibly be referable to the word
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">róf</span>, <em>clamor</em>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">róf</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>celeber</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>famosus</i></span>, and a verb <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">rófan</span> or
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">réfan</span>, <em>to call aloud</em>: if this be so, the name would
denote <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bannitor</i></span>, the summoning or proclaiming officer,
him by whose summons or proclamation the
court and the levy of the freemen were called together;
and this suggestion answers more nearly
than any other to the nature of the original office:
in this sense too, a reeve’s district is called his
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">mánung</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bannum</i></span><a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c012'><sup>[363]</sup></a>. In this comprehensive generality
lay the possibility of so many different degrees
of authority being designated by one term; so that
in the revolutions of society we have seen the German
markgraf and burggraf assuming the rank of
sovereign princes, while the English borough-reeve
has remained the chief magistrate of a petty corporation,
or the pinder of a village has been designated
by the title of a hogreeve.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever were the original signification of the
word, I cannot doubt that it is of the highest antiquity,
as well as the office which it denotes. In all
probability it was borne by those elected chiefs
who presided over the freemen of the Gá in their
meetings, and delivered the law to them in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>districts<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c012'><sup>[364]</sup></a>. Throughout the Germanic constitutions,
and especially in this country, the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> always
appears in connexion with <a id='corr155.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='judical'>judicial</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_155.3'><ins class='correction' title='judical'>judicial</ins></a></span> functions<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c012'><sup>[365]</sup></a>: he
is always the holder of a court of justice: thus:—“Eádweard
the king commandeth all the reeves;
that ye judge such just dooms, as ye know to be
most righteous, and as it in the doombook standeth.
Fear not, on any account, to pronounce folkright;
and let every suit have a term, when it may be
fullfilled, that ye may then pronounce.” Again:—“I
will that each reeve have a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> once in every
four weeks; and so act that every man may have
his right by law; and every suit have an end and
a term when it shall be brought forward.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon this point it is unnecessary to multiply
evidence, and I shall content myself with saying
that wherever there was a court there was a reeve,
and wherever there was a reeve, he held some sort
of court for the guidance and management of persons
for whose peaceful demeanour he was responsible.
From this it is to be inferred that the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span>
were of very different qualities, possessed very
different degrees of power, and had very different
functions to perform, from the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> who gave
law to the shire, down to the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> who managed
some private landowner’s estate. It will be convenient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>to take the different classes of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span> <em>seriatim</em>,
and collect under each head such information
as we can now obtain from our legal or historical
monuments.</p>

<p class='c015'>HEÁHGERÉFA.—In general the word coupled
with <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> enables us to judge of the particular
functions of the officer; but this is not the case
with the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">heáhgeréfa</span> or <em>high reeve</em>, a name of very
indefinite signification, though not very rare occurrence.
It is obvious that it really denotes only a
reeve of high rank, I believe always a royal officer;
but it is impossible to say whether the rank is
personal or official; whether there existed an office
called the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">heáhgeréfscipe</span> (highreevedom) having
certain duties; or whether the circumstance of the
shire- or other reeve being a nobleman in the king’s
confidence gave to him this exceptional title. I
am inclined to believe that they are exceptional,
and perhaps in some degree similar to the Missi of
the Franks,—officers dispatched under occasional
commissions to perform functions of supervision,
hold courts of appeal, and discharge other duties,
as the necessity of the case demanded; but that
they are not established officers found in all the
districts of the kingdom, and forming a settled part
of the machinery of government. In this particular
sense, our judges going down upon their several
circuits, under a commission of jail delivery, are
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">heáhgeréfan</span> of our day.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are told in the Saxon Chronicle that in the
year 778, Æðelbald and Heardberht of Northumberland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>slew three <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">heáhgeréfan</span>, namely Ealhwulf
the son of Bosa, Cynewulf and Ecga: and the immediate
consequence of this appears to have been
the expulsion of Æðelred, and the succession of
Ælfwold to the throne of Northumberland. These
high-reeves were therefore probably military officers
of Æðelred, and Simeon of Durham, in recording
the events of the same year calls them dukes, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duces</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, in 780, Simeon mentions Osbald and
Æðelheard as dukes, but the Chronicle calls them
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">heáhgeréfan</span>.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c012'><sup>[366]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In a <a id='corr157.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='preceeding'>preceding</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_157.12'><ins class='correction' title='preceeding'>preceding</ins></a></span> chapter I have shown that the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dux</i></span> is properly equivalent to the ealdorman, but
this can hardly have been the case with the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">heáhgeréfa</span>.
Again, in 1001, the Chronicle mentions
three high-reeves, Æðelweard, Leófwine and Kola,
and apparently draws a distinction by immediately
naming Eádsige, the king’s reeve, not his
high-reeve. In 1002 the Chronicle again mentions
Æfíc, a high-reeve, who though a great favourite
of the king, certainly never attained the rank of
a duke or ealdorman, or, as far as we know, ever
performed any public administrative functions. He
was a minion of Æðelred’s, but not an officer of
the Anglosaxon state.</p>

<p class='c015'>SCÍRGERÉFA OR SHERIFF.—The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Scírgeréfa</span>
is, as his name denotes, the person who stands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>at the head of the shire, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>pagus</i></span> or county: he is
also called <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Scírman</span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Scírigman</span><a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c012'><sup>[367]</sup></a>. He is properly
speaking the holder of the county-court, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgemót</span>
or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">folcmót</span>, and probably at first was its elected
chief. But as this <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> was at first the people’s
officer, he seems to have shared the fate of the
people, and to have sunk in the scale as the royal
authority gradually rose: during the whole of our
historical period we find him exercising only a concurrent
jurisdiction, shared in and controlled by
the ealdorman on the one hand and the bishop on
the other. The latter interruption may very probably
have existed from the very earliest periods,
and the heathen priest have enjoyed the rights
which the Christian prelate maintained: but the
intervention of the ealdorman appears to be consistent
only with the establishment of a central
power, exercised in different districts by means
of resident superintendents, or occasional commissioners
especially charged with the defence of the
royal interests. In the Anglosaxon legislation
even of the eighth century, the ealdorman is certainly
head of the shire<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c012'><sup>[368]</sup></a>; but there is, as far as I
know, no evidence of his sitting in judgment in
the folcmót without the sheriff, while there is evidence
that the sheriff sat without the ealdorman.
Usually the court was held under the presidency of
the ealdorman and bishop, and of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>who from his later title of vicecomes, vicedominus,
was probably looked upon as the ealdorman’s deputy,—a
strange revolution of ideas. The shiremoot
at Ægelnóðes stán in the days of Cnut was
attended by Æðelstán, bishop of Hereford, Ranig
the ealdorman, Eádwine his son, Leófwine and
Ðurcytel the white, Tofig the king’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>missus</i></span> or messenger,
and Bryning the scírgeréfa<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c012'><sup>[369]</sup></a>. But in a celebrated
trial of title to land at Wouldham in Kent,
where archbishop Dunstán himself was a party
concerned, the case seems to have been disposed
of by Wulfsige the shireman or sheriff alone<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c012'><sup>[370]</sup></a>. The
bishop of Rochester, being in some sort a party to
the suit, could probably not take his place as a
judge, and the ealdorman is not mentioned at all.
Again in an important trial of title to land at Snodland
in Kent, there is no mention whatever of the
ealdorman: the king’s writ was sent to the archbishop;
and the sheriff Leófríc and the thanes of
East and West Kent met to try the cause at Canterbury<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c012'><sup>[371]</sup></a>.
It may then be concluded that the presence
of the sheriff was necessary in any case, while
that of the ealdorman might be dispensed with<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c012'><sup>[372]</sup></a>.
By the provisions of our later kings it appears that
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgemót</span> or sheriff’s court for the county was
to be holden twice in the year, and before this were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>brought all the most important causes, and such as
exceeded the competence of the hundred<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c012'><sup>[373]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the judicial functions of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span> were
by no means all that he had to attend to. It is
clear that the execution of the law was also committed
to his hands. The provisions of the council
of Greatanleah conclude with these words:—“But
if any of my reeves will not do this, and care less
about it than we have commanded, let him pay
the fine for disobeying me, and I will find another
reeve who will do it<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c012'><sup>[374]</sup></a>;” where reference is generally
made to all the enactments of the council. And
the same king requires his bishops, ealdormen and
reeves (the principal shire-officer) to maintain the
peace upon the basis laid down in the Judicia
civitatis Londoniae, that is to put in force the enactments
therein contained, on pain of fines and
forfeiture<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c012'><sup>[375]</sup></a>. In pursuance also of this part of their
duty, they were commanded to protect the abbots
on all secular occasions<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c012'><sup>[376]</sup></a>, and to see the church
dues regularly paid; viz. the tithes, churchshots,
soulshots and plough alms<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c012'><sup>[377]</sup></a>. And Eádgár, Æðelred
and Cnut arm them with the power to levy for
tithe and inflict a heavy forfeiture upon those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>withhold it<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c012'><sup>[378]</sup></a>. It is also very clear from several passages
in the Laws that the sheriff might be called
upon to witness bargains and sales, so as to warrant
them afterwards if necessary. Æðelstán enacts<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c012'><sup>[379]</sup></a>:—“Let
no man exchange any property, without
the witness of the reeve, or the mass-priest, or the
landlord, or the treasurer, or some other credible
man:” and though the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span> is not particularly
mentioned here, it is obvious that he is meant, for
a subsequent law of Eádmund, following this enactment
of Æðelstán, directs that no one shall bargain
or receive strange cattle without the witness of
the highest reeve (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">summi praepositi</span>”), the priest,
the treasurer or the port-reeve<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c012'><sup>[380]</sup></a>. He was further
to exercise a supreme police in his county: it is
declared by Æðelred<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c012'><sup>[381]</sup></a>,—“If there be any man who
is untrue to all the people, let the king’s reeve go
and bring him under surety, that he may be held
to justice, to them that accused him. But if he
have no surety, let him be slain, and laid in the
foul,”—that is, I presume, not buried in consecrated
ground.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this also it appears probable that the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>
was the officer to conduct the execution of criminals
in capital cases, as he remains to this day; but
as far as I remember, there is no instance of this
duty recorded. The regulations respecting mints
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>and coinage seem also to show that this part of the
public service was under the superintendence of the
scírgeréfa<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c012'><sup>[382]</sup></a>. As the principal political officer, and
chief of the freemen in the shire, it was further his
duty to promulgate the laws enacted by the king
and his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span>, and take a pledge from the
members of the county, to observe these: and it is
to be concluded that this was solemnly done in the
county-court<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c012'><sup>[383]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span> was also the principal fiscal officer
in the county. It was undoubtedly his duty to
levy all fines that accrued to the king from offenders,
and to collect such taxes as the land paid for public
purposes. We have unhappily no <em>pipe-rolls</em> of the
Anglosaxon period, which would have thrown the
greatest light upon the social condition of England;
but we have a precept of Cnut, addressed to Æðelríc
the sheriff of Kent, and the other principal officers
and thanes of the county, commanding that
archbishop Æðelnóð shall account only as far as
he had done before Æðelríc <a id='corr162.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='becaem'>became</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_162.21'><ins class='correction' title='becaem'>became</ins></a></span> sheriff, and
ordering that in future no sheriff shall demand
more of him<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c012'><sup>[384]</sup></a>. From this it appears that even the
lands of the archbishop himself were not exempt
from the sheriff’s authority in fiscal matters, although
there can be little doubt that at this period
the prelate had a grant of sacu and sócn, or complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>immunity from the sheriff’s power in judicial
questions. And we shall have little difficulty in
admitting that, if he possessed this authority in the
case of the archbishop, he exercised it in that of
other less distinguished landowners. It has been
already shown that the king possessed certain profitable
rights in, and received contributions from,
the estates of folcland in private hands: these
were exercised and collected by the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span>. It
is probable that the zeal of this officer had sometimes
overstepped the bounds of the law, and induced
him to burthen the free landowner for the
benefit of the crown; for we find Cnut enacting<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c012'><sup>[385]</sup></a>:
“This is the alleviation which it is my pleasure
to secure to all the people, of that which hath heretofore
too much oppressed them. First, I command
all my reeves that they justly provide for me on
my own, and maintain me therewith; and that no
man need give them anything, as farm-aid, unless
he choose. And if after this any one demand a
fine, let him be liable in his wergyld to the king.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The law then goes on to regulate the king’s rights
in case of intestacy, the amount of heriot payable
by different classes, the freedom of succession in
the wife and children, and the freedom of marriage
both for widow and maiden. And as all these laws,
numbered respectively from § 70 to 75, appear
to be dependent upon one another, and to form a
chapter of alleviations by themselves, I conclude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>that the sheriffs had been guilty of exaction in confiscating
the estates of intestates, demanding extravagant
heriots and reliefs, and imposing fines
for licence to marry,—extortions familiar enough
under the Norman rule. It was moreover the sheriff’s
duty to seize into the king’s hands all lands and
chattels belonging to felons, which would, in the
event of a conviction become forfeit to the crown:
of this we have instances. About <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 900, one
Helmstán was guilty of theft; Eanwulf Penhearding,
who was then sheriff, immediately seized all the
property he had at Tisbury, except the land which
Helmstán could not forfeit, as it was only Ordláf’s
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">lǽn</span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>beneficium</i></span><a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c012'><sup>[386]</sup></a>. At the close of the tenth century,
Æscwyn a widow had become implicated in
the theft of some title-deeds by her own son: judgment
was given against her in one of the royal
courts, whereby all her property became forfeited to
the king: Wulfstán the sheriff of Kent accordingly
seized Bromley and Fawkham, her manors<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c012'><sup>[387]</sup></a>. There
is of course every probability that the sheriff was
charged with certain disbursements, required by
the public service, and that he rendered a periodical
account both of receipts and expenditure, to the
officers who then represented the royal exchequer;
but upon this part of the subject we are unhappily
without any evidence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sheriff was naturally the leader of the militia,
posse comitatus, or levy of the free men, who served
under his banner, as the different lords with their dependents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>served under the royal officers, the church
vassals under the bishop’s or abbot’s officer, and all
together under the chief command of the ealdorman
or duke. It was his business to summon them,
and to command them in the field, during the
period of their service: and he thus formed the
connecting link between the military power of the
king and the military power of the people, for purposes
both of offence and defence.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the earliest periods, the office was doubtless
elective, and possibly even to the last the people
may have enjoyed theoretically, at least, a sort of
concurrent choice. But I cannot hesitate for a
moment in asserting that under the consolidated
monarchy, the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span> was nominated by the
king, with or without the acceptance of the county-court,
though this in all probability was never refused<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c012'><sup>[388]</sup></a>.
The language of the laws which continually
adopt the words, <em>our</em> reeves, where none but the
sheriffs are intended, clearly shows in what relation
these officers stood to the king: and as the latter
indisputably possessed the power of removing, he
probably did not want that of appointing them<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c012'><sup>[389]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>On one occasion indeed Æðelstân distinctly declares,
that if his sheriffs neglect their duty, <em>he</em>,
the king, will find others to do it<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c012'><sup>[390]</sup></a>. The means by
which the dignity of the sheriff was supported are
similar to those noticed in the case of the ealdorman.
He received a proportion of the fines payable
to the king: he was, we may presume, always
a considerable landowner in the shire; indeed,
several of those whom we know to have held the
office, were amongst the greatest landowners in
their respective districts<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c012'><sup>[391]</sup></a>. It is even possible that
there may have been some provision in land, attached
to the office, for I meet occasionally with
such words as geréf-land, geréf-mǽd, where the
form of the composition denotes, not the land or
meadow of some particular sheriff, but of the sheriff
generally. As leader of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>shire-fyrd</i></span> or armed
force, the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> would have a share of the booty;
and it is not unreasonable to suppose that his
influence and good-will were secured at times by
the voluntary offerings of neighbours and dependents.</p>

<p class='c001'>The writs of the kings, touching judicial processes,
and other matters connected with the public
service, were directed to the ealdorman, bishop
and sheriff of the district, as a general rule. From
these writs, which are numerous in the eleventh
century, we learn some of the names of the gentlemen
who filled the office at that period: and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>those names are not without interest I have collected
from such documents as we possess a list of
sheriffs for different counties.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>It is possible that increased research may extend
this list of sheriffs, and much to be regretted that
our information is so scanty as it is. We have no
means of deciding whether the office was an annual
one, or how its duration was limited. The
Kentish list shows that the clergy were neither exempt
nor excluded from its toils or advantages: and
the position of Wulfsige the priest and sheriff recalls
to us the earlier times when priest and judge may
have been synonymous terms among the nations of
the north<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c012'><sup>[431]</sup></a>. I now proceed to a third class, the</p>

<p class='c015'>CYNINGES GERÉFA, or Royal Reeve.—There
is some difficulty with regard to this officer,
because in many cases where the cyninges
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> is mentioned, it is plain that the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span>
is meant. For example, Ælfred twice mentions
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cyninges geréfa</span> as sitting in the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">folcmót</span> and
administering justice there<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c012'><sup>[432]</sup></a>, which is hardly to be
understood of any but the sheriff. However it is
consistent with the general principles of Teutonic
society that as there was a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span> to do justice
between freeman and freeman, so also there should
be a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cyninges geréfa</span>, before whom the king’s
tenants should ultimately stand to right, and who
more particularly administered the king’s sacu and.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>sócn in his own private lands. To this officer,
under the ealdorman, would belong the investigation
of those causes which the king’s manorial
courts could not decide: perhaps he might possess
some sort of appellate jurisdiction: and it cannot
be doubted that it was his duty to superintend the
management of the king’s private domains, and to
lead the array of the king’s private tenants in the
general levy. It is therefore not unlikely that this
officer may be identical with the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">heáhgeréfa</span> already
noticed. But in many cases where a king’s reeve
is mentioned, and where we cannot understand the
term of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span>, it is clear that a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wícgeréfa</span>
or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burh-</span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">túngeréfa</span> are intended, and that they
are called royal officers merely because the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wíc</span>,
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burh</span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">tún</span> happened to be royal property. The
Chronicle under the year 787 mentions a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>
who was slain by the Northmen:—“This year
king Beorhtríc took to wife Eádburh, king Offa’s
daughter: and in his time first came three ships
of Northmen from Hæretha land. And then the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> rode to the place, and would have driven
them to the king’s tún, for he knew not who they
were: and there on the spot they slew him. These
were the first Danish ships that ever sought the
land of the English.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Now Florence of Worcester under the same date
tells us that this officer was “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">regis praepositus,</span>”
that is, a king’s reeve: and Henry of Huntingdon
improves him into a sheriff<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c012'><sup>[433]</sup></a>, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praepositus regis
illius provinciae:</span>” Æðelweard however, who is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>obviously much better acquainted with the details
of the story than his Norman successors, records
that this officer’s name was Beadoheard, and that
he was the royal burggrave in Dorchester<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c012'><sup>[434]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 897 again we hear of the death of Lucemon, in
battle against the Danes: the Chronicle calls him
“<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ðæs cyninges geréfa:</span>” but Henry of Huntingdon,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praepositus regalis exercitus<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c012'><sup>[435]</sup></a>,</span>” which may merely
mean the officer appointed to lead the <em>royal</em> force,
that is a king’s reeve in the sense which I have attempted
to establish on a preceding page. Other
king’s reeves mentioned, are Ælfweard, (Chron. Sax.
an. 1011), and Ælfgár (Cod. Dipl. No. 693).</p>

<p class='c001'>It may admit of doubt whether in the parts of
England which were subject to Danish rule, and
only re-annexed to the Westsaxon crown by conquest,
the same institutions prevailed as in the
rest of the country. In the laws of Æðelred<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c012'><sup>[437]</sup></a> we
hear of a king’s reeve in the Wapentake and in the
community of the Five Burgs. These are not sheriffs;
the former rather resembling the Hundred-man;
the latter a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Burhgeréfa</span>, but with extended
powers, perhaps approaching those of a sheriff, or
the Northumbrian <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">heáhgeréfa</span> already alluded to in
this chapter.</p>

<p class='c015'>THE BURHGERÉFA.—In a fortified town,
which I take to be the strict meaning of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>burh</i></span>, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>was an officer under this title. We know but little
of his peculiar powers; but there is every reason to
conclude that they were similar to those of other
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span>, according to the circumstances in which
he was placed. If the town were free, it is possible
that he may have been the popular officer, a sort of
sheriff where the town is itself a county. But this
is improbable, and it is much more likely that the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burhgeréfa</span> was essentially a royal officer, charged
with the maintenance and defence of a fortress.
Such a one I take Badoheard to have been in Dorchester;
similarly we hear of Godwine, praepositus
civitatis Oxnafordi<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c012'><sup>[438]</sup></a>, Æðelwig praepositus in Bucingaham<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c012'><sup>[439]</sup></a>,
and Wynsige also praepositus in Oxnaforda<a href='#f439' class='c012'><sup>[439]</sup></a>,
Osulf and Ylcærðon both praepositi in
Padstow<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c012'><sup>[440]</sup></a>; and finally Ælfred, the reeve of Bath<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c012'><sup>[441]</sup></a>.
It was this officer’s duty to preside in the burhgemót,
which was appointed to be held thrice in
the year<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c012'><sup>[442]</sup></a>, and he was most likely the representative
of the towns-people, so far as these were unfree,
in the higher courts. It is also probable that
he was their military leader, and that he was expected
to be present at sales and exchanges in
order to be able to warrant transactions, if impeached.
Lastly he was to see that tithes were
duly rendered from his fellow-citizens<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c012'><sup>[443]</sup></a>. From a
very interesting document just now cited<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c012'><sup>[444]</sup></a>, it may
be inferred that he possessed considerable power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>in his district, and that persons of rank and wealth
were clothed with the office. We there find the
reeves of Buckingham and Oxford granting the rites
of Christian burial to some Saxon gentlemen who
had perished in a brawl brought on by an attempt
at theft; and the intervention of the king himself
seems to have been necessary to prevent the execution
of their decree. The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burhgeréfa</span> may perhaps
be said to have had some of the rights of the
Aedile and Praetor urbanus under the old, or those
of the duumvir under the later, provincial constitution
of Rome. Still he seems to have been in some
degree subject to the supervision of the ealdorman.
I have sometimes thought that he might be
compared in part with the Burggraf, in part with
the Vogt of the German towns under the Empire;
but unfortunately we know too little of our ancient
municipal constitution to enable us to carry
out this enquiry. We have no means now of
ascertaining the duration of his office, the nature
of his appointment, or the actual extent of his
powers.</p>

<p class='c015'>PORTGERÉFA.—The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Portgeréfa</span> is in many
respects similar to the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Burhgeréfa</span>: but as it appears
that <em>Port</em> is applied rather to a commercial than a
fortified town, there are differences between the two
offices. In some degree these will have depended
upon the comparative power, freedom and organization
of the citizens themselves, and I can readily
believe that the portreeves of London were much
more important personages than the burhreeves of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Oxford or Bath. In the smaller towns, it is probable
that the court of the portreeve was a sort of
pie-powder court; but in the larger, it must have
had cognizance of offences against the customs
laws, the laws affecting the mint, and the general
police of the district. As a general rule I imagine
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">portgeréfa</span> to have been an elective officer:
perhaps in the large and important towns he required
at least the assent of the king. In London
he holds the place of the sheriff, and the king’s
writs are directed to the earl, the bishop and the
portreeve<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c012'><sup>[445]</sup></a>. There are two cities in which we hear
of portreeves, viz. London and Canterbury: in the
former we have Swétman<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c012'><sup>[446]</sup></a>, Ælfsige<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c012'><sup>[447]</sup></a>, Ulf<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c012'><sup>[448]</sup></a>, Leófstán<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c012'><sup>[449]</sup></a>,
and the great officer of the royal household,
Esgár the steallere<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c012'><sup>[450]</sup></a>, which alone would be sufficient
evidence of the importance attached to the post.
In Canterbury we read of Æðelred<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c012'><sup>[451]</sup></a>, Leofstán<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c012'><sup>[452]</sup></a>, and
Gódric<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c012'><sup>[453]</sup></a>, occupying the same station. Again we have
Ælfsige <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">portgeréfa</span> in Bodmin<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c012'><sup>[454]</sup></a>, and Leófcild <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">portgeréfa</span>
in Bath<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c012'><sup>[455]</sup></a>. It is worthy of remark that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>two, Ælfsige and Leófstán, served the office together
in London, and that Ulf also occurs as sheriff of
Middlesex. In the smaller towns especially it must
have been a principal part of the portreeve’s duty
to witness all transactions by bargain and sale<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c012'><sup>[456]</sup></a>. A
portion of his subsistence at least was probably
derived from the proceeds of tolls, and fines levied
within his district.</p>

<p class='c015'>WÍCGERÉFA.—The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Wícgeréfa</span> was a similar
officer, in villages, or in such towns as had grown
out of villages without losing the name of a village.
I presume that he was not concerned with the freemen,
but was a kind of steward of the manor, and
that his dignity varied with the rank of his employer
and the extent of his jurisdiction. However
there is so much difficulty in making a clear
distinction between Port and Wíc, that we find
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wícgeréfa</span> applied to officers who ruled in large
and royal cities. Thus the Saxon Chronicle mentions
Beornwulf under the title of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Wícgeréfa</span> in
Winchester<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c012'><sup>[457]</sup></a>, whom Florence in the same year calls
Praepositus Wintoniensium. And in the laws of
Hloðhere and Eádríc<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c012'><sup>[458]</sup></a>, the same title is given to
the king’s officer in London, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Cyninges wícgeréfa</span>.
In general I should be disposed to construe the
word strictly as a village-reeve, and especially in
any case where the village was not royal, but ducal
or episcopal property. Many places may indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>have once been called by the name of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wíc</i></span> which
afterwards assumed a much more dignified appellation,
together with a much more important social
condition.</p>

<p class='c015'>TÚNGERÉFA.—The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Túngeréfa</span> is literally the
reeve of a tún, enclosure, farm, vill or manor: and
his authority also must have fluctuated with that
of his lord. He is the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>villicus</i></span> or bailiff of the
estate, and on the royal farms was bound to superintend
the cultivation, and keep the peace among
the cultivators. In London he appears to have been
subordinate to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">portgeréfa</span>, and was probably
his officer<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c012'><sup>[459]</sup></a>; it was his business to see that the tolls
were paid. Ælfred commands, in case a man is
committed to prison in the king’s tún, that the reeve
shall feed him, if necessary<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c012'><sup>[460]</sup></a>. This I suppose to be
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">túngeréfa</span>, the officer on the spot who would
be responsible for his security. So Eádgár forbids
his reeves to do any wrong to the other men of the
tún, in respect to the tracking of strange cattle<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c012'><sup>[461]</sup></a>.
Here the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">túngeréfa</span> represents the king, among the
class that would in earlier times have formed a court
of free markmen. That the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">túngeréfa</span> was the
manager of a royal estate appears plainly from an
ordinance of Æðelstán, respecting the doles or charities
which were to issue from the various farms’
domain<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c012'><sup>[462]</sup></a>. “I Æðelstán, with the consent of Wulfhelm
my archbishop, and all my other bishops and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>God’s servants, command all you my reeves, within
my realm, for the forgiveness of my sins, that ye
entirely feed one poor Englishman, if ye have him,
or that ye find another. From every two of my
farms, be there given him monthly one amber of
meal, and one shank of bacon, or a ram worth four
pence, and clothing for twelve months every year.
And ye shall redeem one <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wíteþeów</span>: and let all
this be done for the Lord’s mercy, and for my
sake, under witness of the bishop in whose diocese
it may be. And if the reeve neglect this, let him
make compensation with thirty shillings, and let
the money be distributed to the poor in the tún
where this remains unfulfilled, by witness of the
bishop.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, in the law of Æðelred<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c012'><sup>[463]</sup></a> I find the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tungravius</span>,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">decimates homines</span>, and presbyter charged
with the care of seeing certain alms bestowed and
fasts observed; which seems to denote a special
authority exercised by the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Túngeréfa</span> together with
the heads of the tithings. The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> in a royal vill
may easily have been a person of consideration:
if the Æðelnóð who in 830 was reeve at Eastry in
Kent<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c012'><sup>[464]</sup></a>, were such a one, we find from his will that
he had no mean amount of property to dispose of.</p>

<p class='c001'>SWÁNGERÉFA.—The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Swángeréfa</span>, as his name
denotes, was reeve of that forest-court which till a
late period was known in England as the <em>swainmoot</em>.
It was his business to superintend the swánas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>or swains, the herdsmen and foresters, to watch over
the rights of pasture, and regulate the use which
might be made of the forests. It is probably one
of the oldest constitutional offices, and may have
existed by the same name at a time when the organization
in Marks was common all over England.
From a trial which took place in 825, we find that
he had the supervision of the pastures in the shirewood
or public forest<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c012'><sup>[465]</sup></a>, and from this also it appears
that he was under the immediate superintendence
and control of the ealdorman. The extended organization
which the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">swána gemót</span> attained under
Cnut, may be seen in that prince’s Constitutions
de Foresta<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c012'><sup>[466]</sup></a>. It is probable that there were <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Holtgeréfan</span>
and Wudugeréfan, holtreeves and woodreeves
among the Saxons, having similar duties to
those of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Swángeréfa</span>, but I have not yet met
with these names. They are, I believe, by no means
extinct in many parts of England, any more than
the Landreeve, a designation still current in Devonshire,
and probably elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c001'>WEALHGERÉFA.—The last officer whom I
shall treat of particularly is the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Wealhgeréfa</span> or
Welsh-reeve. This singular title occurs in an entry
of the Saxon Chronicle, <i>anno</i> 897. “The same
year died Wulfríc, the king’s horse-thane, who was
also <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Wealhgeréfa</span>.” There can be no dispute as to
the meaning of the word, but the functions of the
officer designated by it are far from clear. It denotes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>a reeve who had the superintendence of the
Welsh; but the question where this superintendence
was exercised is a very important one. If in
the king’s palace, Wulfríc was set over a certain
number of unfree Britons, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>laeti</i></span> or even serfs, as
their judge and regulator: or he may have had the
superintendence of property belonging to Ælfred
in Wales, which is somewhat less probable: or
lastly he may have been a margrave, whose mission
it was to watch the Welsh border, and defend
the Saxon frontier against sudden incursions. This
I think the least probable of all, inasmuch as I find
no traces of margraves (<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">mearcgeréfan</span>) in Anglosaxon
history. On the contrary the marches in
this country seem to have been always committed
to the care of a duke or ealdorman, not a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>.
Wulfríc’s rank however, which was that of a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mariscalcus</span>
or marshal, is not inconsistent with so great
and distant a command. On the whole therefore I
am disposed to believe that he was a royal reeve to
whose care Ælfred’s Welsh serfs were committed,
and who exercised a superintendence over them in
some one or in all of the royal domains.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> was not necessarily a royal officer:
on the contrary we find bishops, ealdormen, nay
simple nobles with them upon their establishment.
Of course the moment an immunity of sacu and
sócn existed upon any estate, the lord appointed a
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> to hold his court and do right among his
men, as the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span> held court for the freemen
in the shire. And if any proof of this were necessary,
we might find it in the title <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>socnereve</i></span> (<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sócne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>geréfa</span>) which occurs at page 12 of the valuable book
known as ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber de antiquis Legibus,</span>’ but which
would have been much more justly entitled Annals
of the Corporation of London. We may be assured
that in every vill belonging to a bishop or a lay
lord, in every city where there was a cathedral or
a castle, there was found a bisceopes or an <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ealdormannes
geréfa</span>, as the case might be, performing
such functions for the prelate or the noble, as the
king’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> exercised for him; and if there were
an immunity, performing every function that the
royal officer performed. Thus in some towns I can
conceive it very possible that the king’s, ealdorman’s
and bishop’s reeves may have met side by
side and exercised a concurrent jurisdiction: and
as the bishop’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> must have led his armed
retainers, (at least whenever it pleased the prelate
to remember the canons of his church,) this officer
may be compared to the Vogt, Advocatus, Vice-dominus
or Vidame, who fulfilled that duty on the
continent. The bishop’s reeve is empowered by
the king to aid the sheriff in the forcible levy of
tithe<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c012'><sup>[467]</sup></a>; he is recognised in the law of Wihtrǽd as
an intermediary between a dependent of the bishop
and the public courts of justice<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c012'><sup>[468]</sup></a>; the thane’s or
nobleman’s reeve was allowed on various occasions
to act as his attorney: the great landowner
was admonished to appoint reeves over his dependents,
to preserve the peace and represent them
before the law; and lastly so necessary a part of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>nobleman’s establishment is the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> considered to
be, that Ini enacts<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c012'><sup>[469]</sup></a>, “whithersoever a noble journeys,
thither may his reeve accompany him.” Of
course in many cases these <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span> would be merely
stewards<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c012'><sup>[470]</sup></a>, but in nearly all we must consider them
to have been judges in various courts of greater or
less importance, public or private as it might chance
to be. This one original character distinguishes all
alike; whether it be the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span> of a county-court,
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burhgeréfa</span> of a corporation, the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">swángeréfa</span>
of a woodland moot, the mótgeréfa<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c012'><sup>[471]</sup></a> of <em>any
court</em> in which plea could be holden, or the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">túngeréfa</span>
of a vill or dependent settlement, the ancient
steward of a manorial court.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> THE WITENA GEMÓT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The conquest of the Roman provinces in Europe
was accomplished by successive bands of adventurers,
ranged under the banners of various leaders,
whom ambition, restlessness or want of means had
driven from their homes. But the conquest once
achieved, the strangers settled down upon the territory
they had won, and became the nucleus of
nations: in their new settlements they adopted the
rules and forms of institutions to which they had
been accustomed in their ancient home, subject indeed
to such modifications as necessarily resulted
from the mode of the conquest, and their new position
among vanquished populations, generally superior
to themselves in the arts of civilized life. If
we carefully examine the nature of these ventures,
we shall I think come to the conclusion that
they were carried on upon what may be familiarly
termed the joint-stock principle. The owner of a
ship, the supplier of the weapons or food necessary
to set the business on foot, is the great capitalist of
the company: the man of skill and judgment and
experience is listened to with respect and cheerfully
obeyed: the strong arms and unflinching
courage of the multitude complete the work: and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>when the prize is won, the profits are justly divided
among the winners, according to the value of each
man’s contribution to the general utility<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c012'><sup>[472]</sup></a>. But in
such voluntary associations as these, it is clear that
every man retains a certain amount of free will,
that he has a right to consult, discuss and advise,
to assent to or dissent from the measures proposed
to be adopted: even the council of war of such a
band must differ very much from what in our day
goes by that name; where a few officers of high
rank decide, and the mass of the army blindly execute
their plans. It cannot then surprise us that
in such cases everything should be done with the
counsel, consent and leave of the associated adventurers.
The bands were then not too numerous
for general consultation: there was no fear lest
treachery or weakness should betray the plans to
an enemy: the necessities of self-preservation guaranteed
the faith of every individual; for, camped
among hostile and exasperated populations, ignorant
of their tongue, and remote from them in
manners, the German straggler, captive or deserter
could look forward to nothing save a violent death
or a life of weary slavery. Mutual participation in
danger must have given rise to mutual trust.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again the principle upon which the settlement
of the land was effected, was that of associations
for common benefits, and a mutual guarantee of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>peaceful possession<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c012'><sup>[473]</sup></a>. Each man stood engaged to
his neighbour, both as to what he would himself
avoid, and as to what he would maintain. The
public weal was the immediate interest of every individual
member of the state; it came home to him
at every instant of his life, directly, pressing him
either in his property, his freedom or his peace,
not through a long and accidental chain of distant
causes and results. Moreover in an association
based upon the individual freedom of the associates,
each man had a right to guard the integrity of the
compact to which he was himself a party; and not
only a right, but a strong interest in exercising it,
for in proportion to the smallness of the state, is
the effect which the conduct of any single member
may produce upon its welfare. But wherever free
men meet on equal terms of alliance, the will of the
majority is the law of the state. If the minority
be small it must submit, or suffer for rebellion: if
large, and capable of independent action and subsistence,
it may peaceably separate from the majority,
renounce its intimate alliance, and emigrate
to new settlements, where it may at its own leisure,
and in its own way, develop its peculiar views of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>polity, leaving to fortune or to the gods to decide
the abstract question of right between itself and
its opponents. How then is the will of the majority
to be ascertained? Where the number of citizens
is small, the question is readily answered: by the
decision of a public meeting at which all may be
present.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now such public meetings or councils we find in
existence among the Germans from their very first
appearance in history. The graphic pen of Tacitus
has left us a lively description of their nature and
powers, and in some degree their forms of business.
He says<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c012'><sup>[474]</sup></a>,—“In matters of minor import, the chiefs
take counsel together; in weightier affairs, the
whole body of the state: but in such wise, that the
chiefs have the power of discussing and recommending
even those measures, which the will of
the people ultimately decides. They meet, except
some sudden and fortuitous event occur, on fixed
days, either at new or full moon.... This inconvenience
arises from their liberty, that they do not
assemble at once, or at the time for which they are
summoned, but a second or even a third day is wasted
by the delay of those who are to meet. They sit
down, in arms, just as it suits the convenience of
the crowd. Silence is enjoined by the priests, who,
on these occasions, have even the power of coercion.
Then the king, or the prince, or any one,
whom his age, nobility, his honours won in war or
his eloquence may authorise to speak, is listened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>to, more through the influence of persuasion than
the power of command. If his opinion do not
please them, they reject it with murmurs: if it do,
they dash their lances together. The most honourable
form of assent is adoption by clashing of arms.
It is lawful also to bring accusations, and prosecute
capitally before the council. The punishment varies
with the crime. Traitors and deserters they hang
on trees; cowards, the unwarlike, and infamous of
body they bury alive in mud and marsh, with a
hurdle cast over them: the difference of the penalty
has this intention as it were, that crimes should
be made public, but infamous vices hidden, while
being punished.... In the same councils also,
princes are elected, to give law in the shires and villages.
Each has a hundred comrades from among
the people, both to advise him and add to his authority.
They transact no business either of a public
or private nature, without their weapons. But
it is not the custom for any one to begin wearing
them, before the state has approved of him as likely
to be an efficient citizen. Then, in the public
meeting itself, either one of the chiefs, or his father
or a kinsman, decorates the youth with a shield
and javelin. This is their <em>Toga</em>; this is the first
dignity of their youth: before this they appear part
of a household,—after it, of a state.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such then was the nature of a Teutonic parliament
as Tacitus had learnt that it existed in his
time; nor is there the least doubt that he has
described it most truly. And such were all the popular
meetings of later periods, whether shiremoots,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>markmoots, or the great <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>placita</i></span> of kingdoms, folkmoots
in the most extended sense of the term.
Such, at least in theory, and to a great extent in
practice, were the meetings of the Franks under the
Merwingian kings, and even under the Carolings.
It will not be uninteresting or without advantage
to compare with this account the description
which Hincmar, archbishop of Rheims, gives
of the institution as recognised and organized by
Charlemagne, a prince by nature not over well disposed
to popular freedom, and by circumstances
placed in a situation to be very dangerous to it<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c012'><sup>[475]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Charlemagne held Reichstage or Parliaments
twice a year, in May and again in the autumn,
for the general arrangement of the public business.
The earlier of these was attended by the principal
officers of state, the ministers as we should call
them, both lay and clerical, the administrators of
the public affairs in the provinces, and other persons
engaged in the business of government. These,
who are comprehended under the titles of Maiores,
Seniores, Optimates, may possibly have had the
real conduct of the deliberations; but there is no
doubt that the freemen were also present, first
because the general armed muster or Hereban took
place at the same time,—the well-known Campus
Madius or Champ de Mai,—and partly because we
know that all new capitularies added to the existing
law were subjected to their approval<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c012'><sup>[476]</sup></a>. We may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>therefore conclude that they were still possessed of
a share in the business of legislation, although it
may have only amounted to a right of accepting or
rejecting the propositions of others. The king had
his particular curia, court or council, the members
of which were chosen (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">eligebantur</span>”), though how
or by whom we know not, from the laity and the
clergy: probably both the king and the people had
their share in the election. The Seniores, according
to Hincmar, were called “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">propter consilium
ordinandum,</span>” to lead the business; the Minores,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">propter idem consilium suscipiendum,</span>” to accept
the same; but also “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">interdum pariter tractandum,</span>”
sometimes to take a part also in the discussions,
“and to confirm them, not indeed by any inherent
power of their own, but by the moral influence of
their judgment and opinion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The second great meeting comprised only the
seniores and the king’s immediate councillors<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c012'><sup>[477]</sup></a>. It
appears to have been concerned with questions of
revenue as well as general policy. But its main
object was to prepare the business and anticipate
the necessities of the coming year. It was a deliberative
assembly<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c012'><sup>[478]</sup></a> in which questions afterwards
to be submitted to the general meeting were discussed
and agreed upon. The members of this
council were bound to secrecy. When the public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>business had been concluded, they formed a court
of justice and of appeal, for the settlement of litigation
in cases which transcended the powers or
skill of the ordinary tribunals<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c012'><sup>[479]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The general councils were held, in fine weather,
in the open air, or, if occasion required, in houses
devoted to the purpose. The ecclesiastics and the
magnates, for so we may call them, sat apart from
the multitude; but even they had separate chambers,
in which the clergy could deliberate upon
matters purely ecclesiastical, the magnates upon
matters purely civil: but when the object of their
enquiry was of a mixed character, they were called
together<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c012'><sup>[480]</sup></a>. Before these chambers the questions
were brought which had been prepared at the
preceding meeting, or arose from altered circumstances:
the opinion of the members was taken
upon them, and when agreed to they were presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>to the king, who agreed or disagreed in turn, as the
case might be. While the new laws or administrative
regulations were under discussion, the king,
unless especially invited to be present at the deliberations,
occupied himself in mixing with the
remaining multitude, receiving their presents,
welcoming their leaders, conversing with the new
comers, sympathizing with the old, congratulating
the young, and in similar employments, both in
spirituals and temporals, says Hincmar<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c012'><sup>[481]</sup></a>. When
the prepared business had been disposed of, the
king propounded detailed interrogatories to the
chambers, respecting the state of the country in
the different districts, or what was known of the
intentions and actions of neighbouring countries;
and these having been answered or reserved for
consideration, the assembly broke up. When any
new chapters, hence called Capitula, had been
added to the ancient law or folkright, special messengers
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>missi</i></span>) were dispatched into the provinces
to obtain the assent and signatures of the free men,
and the chapters thus ratified became thenceforth
the law of the land. Is it unreasonable to suppose
that the proposals of the princes were also presented
to the assembled freemen, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>reliqua multitudo</i></span>,
in arms upon the spot, and that in the old
German fashion they carried them by acclamation?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>While the district whose members attend the folkmoot
is still small, there is no great inconvenience
in this method of proceeding. In the empire of
Charlemagne attendance upon the Campus Madius,
whether as soldier or councillor must have been a
heavy burthen. Nor can we conceive it to have
been otherwise here, as soon as counties became
consolidated into kingdoms, and kingdoms into an
empire. In a country overrun with forests, intersected
with deep streams or extensive marshes, and
but ill provided with the means of internal communication,
suit and service even at the county-court
must have been a hardship to the cultivator; a
duty performed not without danger, and often vexatiously
interfering with agricultural processes on
which the hopes of the year might depend. Much
more keenly would this have been felt had every
freeman been called upon to attend beyond the
limits of his own shire, in places distant from, and
totally unknown to him: how for example would a
cultivator from Essex have been likely to look upon
a journey into Gloucestershire<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c012'><sup>[482]</sup></a> at the severe season
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>of Christmas<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c012'><sup>[483]</sup></a>, or the, to him, important farming
period of Easter? What moreover could he care
for general laws affecting many districts beside the
one in which he lived, or for regulations applying
to fractions of society in which he had no interest?
for the Saxon cultivator was not then a politician;
nor were general rules which embraced a whole
kingdom of the same moment to him, as those
which might concern the little locality in which his
alod lay. Or what benefit could be expected from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>his attendance at deliberations which concerned
parts of the country with whose mode of life and
necessities he was totally unacquainted? Lastly,
what evil must not have resulted to the republic
by the withdrawal of whole populations from their
usual places of employment, and the congregating
them in a distant and unknown locality? If we
consider these facts, we shall find little difficulty in
imagining that any scheme which relieved him from
this burthen and threw it upon stronger shoulders,
would be a welcome one, and the foundation of a
representative system seems laid <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>à priori</i></span>, and in
the nature of things itself. To the rich and powerful
neighbour whose absence from his farms was
immaterial, while his bailiffs remained on the spot
to superintend their cultivation; to the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfa</span>,
the ealdorman, the royal reeve, or royal thane, familiar
with the public business, and having influence
and interest with the king; to the bishop or
abbot, distinguished for his wisdom as well as his
station; to any or all of these he would be ready
to commit the defence of his small, private interests,
satisfied to be virtually represented if he were
not compelled to leave the business and the enjoyments
of his daily life<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c012'><sup>[484]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, to whom could the king look
with greater security, than to the men whose sympathies
were all those of the ruling caste; many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>of whom were his own kinsmen by blood or marriage,
more of whom were his own officers; men,
too, accustomed to business, and practically acquainted
with the wants of their several localities?
Or how, when the customs and condition of widely
different social aggregations were to be considered
and reconciled, could he do better than advise with
those who were most able to point out and meet
the difficulties of the task? Thus, it appears to
me, by a natural process did the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">folkmót</span> or meeting
of the nation become converted into a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena
gemót</span> or meeting of councillors. Nor let it be
imagined by this that I mean the king’s councillors
only: by no means; they were the witan or councillors
of the nation, members of the great council
or inquest, who sought what was for the general
good, certainly not men who accidentally formed
part of what we in later days call the king’s council,
and who might have been more or less the
creatures of his will: they were <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">leódwitan</span>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þeódwitan</span>,
general, popular, universal councillors: only
when they chanced to be met for the purpose of
advising him could they bear the title of the
cyninges þeahteras or cyninges witan. Then no
doubt the Leódwitan became <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ðæs cyninges witan</span>
(<em>the</em> king’s, not king’s, councillors) because without
their assistance he could not have enacted, nor
without their assistance executed, his laws. Let it
be borne in mind throughout that the king was
only the head of an aristocracy which acted with
him, and by whose support he reigned; that this
aristocracy again was only a higher order of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>freemen, to whose class it belonged, and with many
of whose interests it was identified; that the clergy,
learned, active and powerful, were there to mediate
between the rulers and the ruled; and I think we
shall conclude that the system which I have faintly
sketched was not incapable of securing to a great
degree the well-being of a state in such an early
stage of development as the Saxon Commonwealth.
At what exact period the change I have attempted
to describe was effected, is neither very easy to
determine nor very material. It was probably very
gradual, and very partial; indeed it may never have
been formally recognised, for here and there we
find evident traces of the people’s being present
at, and ratifying the decisions of the witan. Much
more important is it to consider certain details
respecting the composition, powers and functions of
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> as we find it in periods of ascertained
history. The documents contained in the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Diplomaticus Ævi Saxonici</span> enable us to do
this in some degree. In that collection there are
several grants which are distinctly stated to have
been made in such meetings of the witan, by and
with their consent, and the signatures to which
may be assumed to be those of members present
on the occasion. Among these we find the king,
frequently the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">æðelings</span> or princes of the blood,
generally the archbishops and all or some of the
bishops and abbots; all or some of the dukes or
ealdormen; sometimes priests and deacons; and
generally a large attendance of milites, ministri or
thanes, many of whom must unhesitatingly be asserted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>to be royal officers, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span> and the like, in
the shires<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c012'><sup>[485]</sup></a>. From one document it is evident that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the sheriffs of all the counties were present<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c012'><sup>[486]</sup></a>: and
in a few cases we meet with names accompanied
by no special designation. Now it appears that a
body so constituted would have been very competent
to advise for the general good; and I do not
scruple to express my opinion that under such a
system the interests of the country were very fairly
represented; especially as there were then no parliamentary
struggles to make the duration of ministries
dependent upon the counting up of single
votes; and contests for the representation of counties
or boroughs would have been as much without
an object in those days, as they are important
in our own; above all, since there was then
no systematic voting of money for the public
service.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Among the charters from which we derive our
information as to the constituent members of the
gemót, one or two appear to be signed by the queen
and other ladies, always I believe, ecclesiastics of
rank and wealth. I do not however, on this account,
argue that such women formed parts of the
regular body. In many cases it is clear that when
a grant had been made by the king and his witan,
the document was drawn up, and offered for attestation
to the principal persons present or easily
accessible. When the queen had accompanied her
consort to the place where the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was held, or
when, as was usual, the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> attended the king
at one of his own residences to assist in the hospitalities
of Christmas and Easter, it was natural that
the first lady of the land should be asked to witness
grants of land, and other favours conferred upon
individuals: it was a compliment to herself, not less
than to him whom she honoured with her signature.
But I know no instance where the record of any
solemn public business is so corroborated; nor
does it follow that the document which was drawn
up in accordance with the resolution of a gemót
should necessarily be signed in the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> itself. It
may have been executed subsequently at the king’s
festal board, and in presence of the members of his
court and household. The case of abbesses, if not
disposed of by the arguments just advanced, must
be understood of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemóts</span> in which the interests of
the monastic bodies were concerned. Here it is
possible that ladies of high rank at the head of nunneries
may have attended to watch the proceedings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>of the synod and attest its acts. Again, where the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> acted as a high court of justice, which often
was the case, a lady who had been party to a
cause might naturally be called upon to sign the
record of the judgment. The instances however
in which the signatures of women occur are very
rare.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the members of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> are called
in Saxon generally by the name of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>witan</i></span><a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c012'><sup>[487]</sup></a>, they are
decorated with very various titles in the Latin
documents. Among these the most common are
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maiores natu, Sapientes, Principes, Senatores, Primates,
Optimates, Magnates</span>, and in three or four
charters they are designated <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Procuratores patriae</span><a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c012'><sup>[488]</sup></a>,
which last title however seems confined to the
thanes, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span> or other members below the rank
of an ealdorman. In the prologue to the laws of
Wihtrǽd they are called <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ða eádigan</span>, for which I
know no better translation than the Spanish <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>Ricos
hombres</i></span>, where the wealth of the parties is certainly
not the leading idea. But whatever be their titles
they are unquestionably looked upon as representing
the whole body of the people, and consequently
the national will: and indeed in one charter of
Æðelstán, an. 931, the act is said to have been
confirmed “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tota plebis generalitate ovante,</span>” with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the approbation of all the people<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c012'><sup>[489]</sup></a>; and the act of
a similar meeting at Winchester in 934, which
was attended by the king, four Welsh princes, two
archbishops, seventeen bishops, four abbots, twelve
dukes, and fifty-two thanes, making a total of
ninety-two persons, is described to have been executed
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tota populi generalitate</span><a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c012'><sup>[490]</sup></a>.” On one occasion
a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> is mentioned of which the members are
called the king’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">heáhwitan</span>, or high councillors<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c012'><sup>[491]</sup></a>:
it is impossible to say whether this is intended
to mark a difference in their rank. If it were, it
might be referred to the analogy of the autumnal
meetings in Charlemagne’s constitution, but nothing
has yet been met with to confirm this hypothesis,
which, in itself, is not very probable.</p>

<p class='c001'>The largest amount of signatures which I have
yet observed is 106, but numbers varying from 90
to 100 are not uncommon, especially after the consolidation
of the monarchy<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c012'><sup>[492]</sup></a>. In earlier times, and
smaller kingdoms, the numbers must have been
much less: the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> which decided upon the reception
of Christianity in Northumberland was held
in a room<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c012'><sup>[493]</sup></a>, and Dunstan met the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">witan</span> of England
in the upper floor of a house at Calne<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c012'><sup>[494]</sup></a>. Other
meetings, which were rather in the nature of conventions,
and were held in the presence of armies,
may have been much more numerous and tumultuary,—much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>more like the ancient armed folkmoot
or the famous day which put an end to the
Merwingian dynasty among the Franks<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c012'><sup>[495]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the members of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> were not
elected, in any sense which we now attach to the
word, I hold to be indisputable: elective witan
ceased together with elective <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgeréfan</span> or ealdormen<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c012'><sup>[496]</sup></a>.
But in a system so elastic as the Saxon, it
is conceivable that an ealdorman, bishop or other
great <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wita</span> may have occasionally carried with him
to the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> some friend or dependent whose wisdom
he thought might aid in the discussions, or
whom the opinion of the neighbourhood designated
as a person well calculated to advise for the general
good,—a slight trace, but still a trace, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>ancient popular right to be present at the settlement
of public business. To this I attribute the
frequent appearance of priests and deacons, who
probably attended in the suite of prelates, and
would be useful assessors when clerical business
was brought before the council. Generally, I imagine,
the witan after having once been called by
writ or summons, met like our own peers, as a
matter of course, whenever a parliament was proclaimed;
and that they were summoned by the
king, either <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro hac vice</i></span>, or generally, can be clearly
shown. Æðelstán, speaking of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemóts</span> at
Greatanleá, Exeter, Feversham and Thundersfield,
says that the consultations were made, before the
archbishop, the bishops, and the witan present,
<em>whom the king himself had named</em>: “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Swá Æðelstán
cyng hit gerǽed hæfð, ⁊ his witan, ǽrest æt Greátanleá,
⁊ eft æt Exanceastre, ⁊ syððám æt Fæfreshám,
⁊  feorðan síðe æt Ðunresfelda, beforan ðám
arcebiscope, ⁊ eallum ðám bisceopan, ⁊ his witum,
ðe se cyng silf namode, ðe ðǽron wǽron</span><a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c012'><sup>[497]</sup></a>.” How
these appointments took place is not very material,
but as the witan were collected from various parts
of England, it is not unreasonable to suppose that
it was by the easy means of a writ and token, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gewrit
and insigel</i></span>. The meeting was proclaimed some
time in advance, at some one of the royal residences<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c012'><sup>[498]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The proper Saxon name for these assemblies was
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span><a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c012'><sup>[499]</sup></a>, literally the meeting of the witan;
but we also find, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">micel gemót</span>, the great meeting;
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sinoðlíc gemót</span>, the synodal meeting; <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">seonoð</span>, the
synod. The Latin names are <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">concilium, conventus,
synodus, synodale conciliabulum</span>, and the like.
Although synodus and seonoð might more properly
be confined to ecclesiastical conventions, the Saxons
do not appear to have made any distinction; probably
because ecclesiastical and secular regulations
were made by the same body, and at the same time.
But it is very probable that the Frankish system of
separate houses for the clergy and laity prevailed
here also, and that merely ecclesiastical affairs were
decided by the king and clergy alone. There are
some acts in which the signatures are those of
clergymen only, others in which the clerical signatures
are followed and, as it were, confirmed by
those of the laity; and in one remarkable case of
this kind, the king signs at the head of each list, as
if he had in fact affixed his mark successively in
the two houses, as president of each<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c012'><sup>[500]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>A more important question for us is, what were
the powers of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span>? It must be answered
by examples in detail.</p>

<p class='c001'>1. <i>First, and in general, they possessed a consultative
voice, and right to consider every public act,
which could be authorised by the king.</i> This has been
attempted to be denied, but without sufficient reason.
Runde, who is one of the upholders of the
erroneous doctrine on this subject, appeals to the
introduction of Christianity into Kent, which he
perhaps justly declares to have been made without
the assent of the witan<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c012'><sup>[501]</sup></a>. But it does not at all
follow that the first reception of Augustine by Æðelberht
is to be considered a public act, or that it
had any immediate consequences for the public law.
Nor is it certain that at a later period, a meeting
of the witan may not have ratified the private proceeding
of the king. Æðelberht, who had some
experience of Christianity from the doctrine and
practice of his Frankish consort Beorhte, may have
chosen to trust to the silent, gradual working of
the missionaries, without courting the opposition of
a heathen <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span>, till assured of success: his
court were already accustomed to the sight of a
Christian bishop and clergy in Beorhte’s suite, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Augustine with his company might easily pass for
a mere addition to that department of the royal
household. Indeed Augustine himself does not appear
to have been at all ambitious of martyrdom,
and probably preferred trying the chances of a gradual
progress to a stormy and perhaps fatal collision
with a body of barbarians, led by a pagan and
rival priesthood. The words of Beda therefore can
prove nothing in the matter, except indeed what is
most important for us, viz. that Æðelberht at first
refused to interfere as king, that is, would not make
a public question of Augustine’s mission<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c012'><sup>[502]</sup></a>. But
Runde seems to have forgotten that Æðelberht’s
laws, which must be dated between 596 and 605,
do most emphatically recognise Christianity and
the Christian priesthood; and as Beda declares
him to have enacted these laws “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum consilio
sapientum</span><a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c012'><sup>[503]</sup></a>,” we shall hardly be saying too much
if we affirm that the introduction of Christianity
was at least ratified by a solemn act of the witan.
Runde’s further remarks upon the conversion of
Northumberland seem to prove that he really never
read through the passages he himself cites, so completely
do they refute his own arguments<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c012'><sup>[504]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. <em>The witan deliberated upon the making of new
laws which were to be added to the existing <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">folcriht</span><a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c012'><sup>[505]</sup></a>,
and which were then promulgated by their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>and the king’s authority<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c012'><sup>[506]</sup></a>.</em> Beda, in a passage just
cited, says of Æðelberht:—“Amongst other benefits
which consulting, he bestowed upon his nation,
he gave her also, with the advice of his witan,
decrees of judgments, after the example of the
Romans: which, written in the English tongue,
are yet possessed and observed by her<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c012'><sup>[507]</sup></a>.” And
these laws were enacted by their authority, jointly
with the king’s. The Prologue to the law of Wihtrǽd
declares:—“These are the dooms of Wihtrǽd,
king of the men of Kent. In the reign of the
most clement king of the men of Kent, Wihtrǽd, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>the fifth year of his reign, the ninth indiction<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c012'><sup>[508]</sup></a>. the
sixth day of the month Rugern, in the place which
is called Berghamstead<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c012'><sup>[509]</sup></a>, where was assembled a
deliberative convention of the great men<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c012'><sup>[510]</sup></a>; there
was Brihtwald the high-bishop<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c012'><sup>[511]</sup></a> of Britain, and the
aforenamed king; also the bishop of Rochester;
the same was called Gybmund, he was present; and
every degree of the church in that tribe, spake
in unison with the obedient people<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c012'><sup>[512]</sup></a>. There the
great men decreed, with the suffrages of all, these
dooms, and added them to the lawful customs of
the men of Kent, as hereafter is said and declared<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c012'><sup>[513]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The prologue to the laws of Ini establishes the
same fact for Wessex; he says,—“Ini, by the grace
of God, king of the Westsaxons, with the advice
and by the teaching of Cénred, my father, and of
Hedde my bishop, and Ercenwold my bishop, with
all my ealdormen, and the most eminent witan of
my people, and also with a great assemblage of
God’s servants<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c012'><sup>[514]</sup></a>, have been considering respecting
our soul’s heal, and the stability of our realm; so
that right law, and right royal judgments might
be settled and confirmed among our people; so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>none of our ealdormen, nor of those who are subject
unto us, should ever hereafter turn aside these
our dooms<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c012'><sup>[515]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And this is confirmed in more detail by Ælfred.
This prince, after giving some extracts from the
Levitical legislation, and deducing their authority
through the Apostolical teaching, proceeds to engraft
upon the latter the peculiar principle of
bót or compensation which is the characteristic
of Teutonic legislation<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c012'><sup>[516]</sup></a>. He says,—“After this it
happened that many nations received the faith
of Christ; and then were many synods assembled
throughout all the earth, and among the English
race also, after they had received the faith of Christ,
of holy bishops, and also of their exalted witan.
They then ordained, out of that mercy which Christ
had taught, that secular lords, <em>with their leave</em>,
might without sin take for almost every misdeed—for
the first offence—the bót in money which they
then ordained; except in cases of treason against a
lord, to which they dared not to assign any mercy;
because Almighty God adjudged none to them that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>despised him, nor did Christ, the son of God, adjudge
any to him that sold him unto death: and
he commanded that a lord should be loved like
oneself<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c012'><sup>[517]</sup></a>. They then, in many synods, decreed a bót
for many human misdeeds; and in many synod-books
they wrote, here one doom, there another.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I, Ælfred the king, gathered these together,
and commanded many of those which our
forefathers held, and which seemed good to me, to
be written down; and many which did not seem
good to me, I rejected by the counsel of my witan,
and commanded them in other wise to be holden;
but much of my own I did not venture to set down
in writing, for I knew not how much of it might
please our successors. But what I met with,
either of the time of Ini my kinsman, or of Offa,
king of the Mercians, or Æðelberht who first of
the English race received baptism, the best I have
here collected, and the rest rejected. I then, Ælfred
king of the Westsaxons, showed these to all my
witan, and they then said, that it liked them well
so to hold them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The laws of Eádweard like those of Hloðhere
and Eádríc have no proem: next in order of time
are those of Æðelstán. The council of Greatley
opens with an ordinance which the king says was
framed by the advice of Wulfhelm, archbishop of
Canterbury and his other bishops: no other witan
are mentioned. Now it is remarkable enough that
this ordinance refers exclusively to tithes, and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>ecclesiastical dues, and works of charity. But the
secular ordinances which follow conclude with these
words: “All this was established in the great synod
at Greátanleá; in which was archbishop Wulfhelm,
with all the noblemen and witan whom Æðelstán
the king [commanded to] gather together<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c012'><sup>[518]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The witan at Exeter, under the same king, are
much more explicit as to their powers: in the
preamble to their laws, they say: “These are the
dooms which the witan at Exeter decreed, with the
counsel of Æðelstán the king, and again at Feversham,
and a third time at Thundersfield, where
the whole was settled and confirmed together<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c012'><sup>[519]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The concurrence of these witan is continually
appealed to in the Saxon laws which follow<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c012'><sup>[520]</sup></a>, and
which are supplementary to the three <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemóts</span> mentioned.
But in a chapter (§ 7) concerning ordeals,
the regulation is said to be by command of God,
the archbishop and all the bishops, and the other
witan are not mentioned; probably because the administration
of the ordeal was a special, ecclesiastical
function. Again in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Judicia Civitatis Londoniae</span>
the joint legislative authority of the king
and the witan is repeatedly alluded to<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c012'><sup>[521]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Eádmund commences his laws by stating that he
had assembled a great <em>synod</em> in London at Easter,
at which the two archbishops, Oda and Wulfstan,
were present, together with many bishops and
persons of ecclesiastical as well as secular condition<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c012'><sup>[522]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>And having thus given the authority by
which he acted, he proceeds to the details of his
law, which he again declares to have been promulgated,
after deliberation with the council of his
witan, ecclesiastical and lay<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c012'><sup>[523]</sup></a>. The council of Culinton,
held under the same prince, commences
thus: “This is the decree which Eádmund the
king and his bishops, with his witan, established
at Culinton, concerning the maintenance of peace,
and taking the oaths of fidelity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Next comes Eádgár, whose law commences in
these words: “This is the ordinance which Eádgár
the king, with the counsel of his witan, ordained,
to the praise of God, his own honour, and the benefit
of all his people<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c012'><sup>[524]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In like manner, Æðelred informs us that his law
was ordained, “for the better maintenance of the
public peace, by himself and his witan at Woodstock,
in the land of the Mercians, according to
the laws of the Angles<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c012'><sup>[525]</sup></a>.” In precisely similar terms
he speaks of new laws made by himself and his
witan at Wantage<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c012'><sup>[526]</sup></a>. In a collection of laws passed
in 1008, under the same prince, we find the following
preamble<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c012'><sup>[527]</sup></a>: “This is the ordinance which
the king of the English, with his witan, both clerical
and lay, have chosen<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c012'><sup>[528]</sup></a> and advised;” and every
one of the first five paragraphs commences with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>the same solemn words, viz. “This is the ordinance
of our lord, and of his witan,” etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>But far more strongly is this marked in the provisions
of the council of Enham, under the same
miserable prince. These are not only entitled,
“ordinances of the witan<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c012'><sup>[529]</sup></a>,” but throughout, the
king is never mentioned at all, and many of the
chapters commence, “It is the ordinance of the
witan,” etc. If it were not for one or two enactments
referring to the safety of the royal person,
and the dignity of the crown, we might be almost
tempted to imagine that the great councillors of
state had met, during Æðelred’s flight from England,
and passed these laws upon their own authority,
without the king. The laws of 1014 commence
again with the words so often repeated in
this chapter<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c012'><sup>[530]</sup></a>, and such also usher in the very elaborate
collection which Cnut and his witan compiled
at Winchester<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c012'><sup>[531]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now I think that any impartial person will be
satisfied with these examples, and admit that whoever
the witan may have been, they possessed a
legislative authority, at least conjointly with the
king. Indeed of two hypothetical cases, I should
be far more inclined to assert that they possessed
it without him, than that he possessed it without
them: at least, I can find no instance of the latter;
while I have shown that there was at least a probability
of the former: and even Æðelred himself
says, twice: “Wise in former days were those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>secular witan<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c012'><sup>[532]</sup></a> who first added secular laws to the
just divine laws, for bishops and consecrated bodies;
and reverenced for love of God holiness and holy
orders, and God’s houses and his servants firmly
protected.” Again<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c012'><sup>[533]</sup></a>: “Wise were those secular
witan who to the divine laws of justice added secular
laws for the government of the people; and
decreed bót to Christ and the king, that many
should thus, of necessity, be compelled to right.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it not manifest that he, like Ælfred, really
felt the legislative power to reside in the witan,
rather than in the king?</p>

<p class='c001'>3. <i>The witan had the power of making alliances
and treaties of peace, and of settling their terms.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The defeat of the Danes by Ælfred, in 878, was
followed, as is well known, by the baptism of Guðorm
Æðelstán, and the peaceful establishment
of his forces in portions of the ancient kingdoms
of Mercia, Essex, Eastanglia and Northumberland.
The terms of this treaty, and the boundaries of the
new states thus constituted were solemnly ratified,
perhaps at Wedmore<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c012'><sup>[534]</sup></a>; the first article of this important
public act, by which Ælfred obtained a considerable
accession of territory, runs thus<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c012'><sup>[535]</sup></a>: “This
is the peace that Ælfred the king, and Gyðrum
the king, and the witan of all the English nation,
and all the people that are in Eastanglia, have all
ordained and confirmed with oaths, for themselves
and for their descendants, born and unborn, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>desire God’s favour or ours. First, concerning our
land-boundaries,” etc. In like manner the treaty
which Eádweard entered into with the same Danes,
is said to have been frequently (“oft and unseldan”)
renewed and ratified by the witan<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c012'><sup>[536]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>We still have the terms of the shameful peace
which Æðelred bought of Olafr Tryggvason and
his comrades in 994. The document, which was
probably signed at Andover<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c012'><sup>[537]</sup></a>, commences with the
following words: “These are the articles of peace
and the agreement which Æðelred the king and
all his witan have made with the army which accompanied
Anlaf, and Justin and Guðmund, the
son of Stegita<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c012'><sup>[538]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Many other instances might be cited, as for example
the entry in the Chronicle, anno 947, where
it is stated that Eádred made a treaty of peace
with the witan of Northumberland at Taddenes
scylf, which was broken and renewed in the following
year: but further evidence upon this point
seems unnecessary<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c012'><sup>[539]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>4. <i>The witan had the power of electing the king.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The kingly dignity among the Anglosaxons was
partly hereditary, partly elective: that is to say, the
kings were usually taken from certain qualified families,
but the witan claimed the right of choosing
the person whom they would have to reign. Their
history is filled with instances of occasions when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>the sons or direct descendants of the last king
have been set aside in favour of his brother or
some other prince whom the nation believed more
capable of ruling: and the very rare occurrence
of discontent on such occasions both proves the
authority which the decision of the witan carried
with it, and the great discretion with which
their power was exercised. Only here and there,
when the witan were themselves not unanimous,
do we find any traces of dissensions arising out of
a disputed succession<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c012'><sup>[540]</sup></a>. On every fresh accession,
the great compact between the king and the people
was literally, as well as symbolically, renewed,
and the technical expression for ascending the
throne is being “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gecoren and áhafen tó cyninge</span>,”
elected and raised to be king: where the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>áhafen</i></span>
refers to the old Teutonic custom of what we still
at election times call chairing the successful candidate;
and the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gecoren</i></span> denotes the positive and
foregone conclusion of a real election. Alfred’s
own accession is a familiar instance of this fact:
he was chosen, to the prejudice of his elder brother’s
children; but the nation required a prince
capable of coping with dangers and difficulty, and
Asser tells us that he was not only received as
king by the unanimous assent of the people, but
that, had he so pleased, he might have dethroned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>his brother Æðelred and reigned in his place<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c012'><sup>[541]</sup></a>.
His words are: “In the same year (871) the aforesaid
Ælfred, who hitherto, during the life of his
brother, had held a secondary place, immediately
upon Æðelred’s death, by the grace of God, assumed
the government of the whole realm, with
the greatest goodwill of all the inhabitants of the
kingdom; which indeed, even during his aforesaid
brother’s life, he might, had he chosen, have done
with the greatest ease, and by the universal consent;
truly, because both in wisdom and in all
good qualities he much excelled all his brothers;
and moreover because he was particularly warlike,
and successful in nearly all his battles<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c012'><sup>[542]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Not one word have we here about his nephews,
or any rights they might possess: and Asser seems
to think royalty itself a matter entirely dependent
upon the popular will, and the good opinion entertained
by the nation of its king. I shall conclude
this head by citing a few instances from Saxon
documents of the intervention of the witan in a
king’s election and inauguration.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 924, the Chronicle says: “This year died
Eádweard the king at Fearndún, among the Mercians
... and Æðelstán was chosen king by the
Mercians, and consecrated at Kingston.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Florence of Worcester, an. 959, distinctly asserts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>that Eádgar was elected by all the people of England,—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab
omni Anglorum populo electus ... regnum
suscepit.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>In 979, the Chronicle again says: “This year
Æðelred took to the kingdom; and he was soon
after consecrated king at Kingston, with great rejoicing
of the English witan.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1016, the election of Eádmund írensída is
thus related: “Then befel it that king Æðelred
died ... and then after his death, all the witan
who were in London, and the townsmen, chose
Eádmund to be king.” Again in 1017: “This
year was Cnut elected king.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1036 again we have these words: “This year
died Cnut the king at Salisbury ... and soon after
his decease there was a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> of all the witan
(‘<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ealra witena gemót</span>’) at Oxford: and Leófríc
the eorl, and almost all the thanes north of the
Thames, and the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>lithsmen</i></span> in London chose Harald
to be chief of all England; to him and his brother
Hardacnut who was in Denmark.” This election
was opposed unsuccessfully by Godwine and
the men of Wessex.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Chronicle contains a very important entry
under the date 1014. Upon the death of Swegen,
we are told that his army elected Cnut king:
“But all the witan who were in England, both
clerical and lay, decided to send after king Æðelred<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c012'><sup>[543]</sup></a>;
and they declared that no lord could be
dearer to them than their natural lord, if he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>rule them more justly than he had done before.
Then the king sent his son Eádweard hither, with
his messengers, and commanded them to greet all
his people<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c012'><sup>[544]</sup></a>; and he said that he would be a loving
lord to them, and amend all those things which
they all abhorred; and that everything which had
been said or done against him should be forgiven,
on condition that they all, with one consent and
without deceit, would be obedient to him. Then
they established full friendship, by word and pledge
on either side, and declared every Danish king an
outlaw from England for ever.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Cnut nevertheless succeeded; but after the extinction
of his short-lived dynasty, we are told that
all the people elected Eádweard the Confessor king.
“1041. This year died Hardacnut.... And before
he was buried, all the people elected Eádweard
king, at London.” Another manuscript reads:—“1042.
This year died Hardacnut, as he stood at
his drink.... And all the people then received Eádweard
for their king, as was his true natural right.”</p>

<p class='c001'>One more quotation from a manuscript of the
Saxon Chronicle shall conclude this head:—“1066.
In this year was hallowed the minster at Westminster
on Childermas-day (Dec. 28th). And king
Eádweard died on the eve of Twelfth-day, and he
was buried on Twelfth-day in the newly consecrated
church at Westminster. And Harald the earl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>succeeded to the kingdom of England, even as the
king had granted it unto him, and men also had
elected him thereto. And he was consecrated king
on Twelfth-day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The witan of England had met to aid in the consecration
of Westminster Abbey, and, as was their
full right, proceeded to elect a king, on Eádweard’s
decease.</p>

<p class='c001'>5. <i>The witan had the power to depose the king, if
his government was not conducted for the benefit of
the people.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>It is obvious that the very existence of this
power would render its exercise an event of very
rare occurrence. Anglosaxon history does however
furnish one clear example. In 755, the witan of
Wessex, exasperated by the illegal conduct of king
Sigeberht, deposed him from the royal dignity, and
elected his relative Cynewulf in his stead. The
fact is thus related by different authorities. The
Chronicle<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c012'><sup>[545]</sup></a> says very shortly:—“This year, Cynewulf
and the witan of the Westsaxons deprived his
kinsman Sigeberht of his kingdom, except Hampshire<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c012'><sup>[546]</sup></a>,
for his unjust deeds.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Florence tells the same story, but in other
words<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c012'><sup>[547]</sup></a>:—“Cynewulf, a scion of the royal race of
Cerdic, with the counsel of the Westsaxon <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>primates</i></span>,
removed their king Sigeberht from his realm,
on account of the multitude of his iniquities, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>reigned in his place: however he granted to him
one province, which is called Hampshire.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Æðelweard<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c012'><sup>[548]</sup></a>, whose royal descent and usual pedantry
conspire to make his account of the matter
somewhat hazy, says:—“So, after the lapse of a
year from the time when Sigeberht began to reign,
Cynewulf invaded his realm and took it from him;
and he drew the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sapientes</i></span> of all the western country
after him, apparently, on account of the irregular
acts of the said king,” etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fullest account however of the whole transaction
is given by Henry of Huntingdon<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c012'><sup>[549]</sup></a>, who very
frequently shows a remarkable acquaintance with
Saxon authorities which are now lost, but from
which he translates and quotes at considerable
length. These are his words:—“Sigeberht, the
kinsman of the aforesaid king, succeeded him, but
he held the kingdom for a short time only: for
being swelled up and insolent through the successes
of his predecessor, he became intolerable even unto
his own people. But when he continued to ill-use
them in every way, and either twisted the laws to
his own advantage, or turned them aside for his
advantage, Cumbra, the noblest of his ealdormen,
at the petition of the whole people, brought their
complaints before the savage king. Whom, for attempting
to persuade him to rule his people more
mercifully, and setting his inhumanity aside to
show himself an object of love to God and man, he
shortly after commanded to be put to an impious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>death: and becoming still more fierce and intolerable
to his people, he aggravated his tyranny. In
the beginning of the second year of his reign, Sigeberht
the king continuing incorrigible in his pride
and iniquity, the princes and people of the whole
realm collected together; and by provident deliberation
and unanimous consent of all he was expelled
from the throne. But Cynewulf, an excellent
young prince, of the royal race, was elected to be
king<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c012'><sup>[550]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I have little doubt that an equally formal, though
hardly equally justifiable, proceeding severed Mercia
from Eádwig’s kingdom, and reconstituted it
as a separate state under Eádgar<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c012'><sup>[551]</sup></a>; and lastly from
Simeon of Durham we learn that the Northumbrian
Alchred was deposed and exiled, with the counsel
and consent of all his people<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c012'><sup>[552]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>6. <i>The king and the witan had power to appoint
prelates to vacant sees.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>As many of the witan were the most eminent of
the clergy, and the people might be fairly considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>to be represented by the secular members of the
body, these elections were perhaps more canonical
than the Frankish, and assuredly more so than those
which take place under our system by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>congé d’élire</i></span>.
The necessary examples will be found in the Saxon
Chronicle, an. 971, 995, 1050. But one may be
mentioned at length. In 959 Dúnstán was elected
archbishop of Canterbury “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">consilio sapientum</span><a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c012'><sup>[553]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>7. <i>They had also power to regulate ecclesiastical
matters, appoint fasts and festivals, and decide upon
the levy and expenditure of ecclesiastical revenue.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>The great question of monachism which convulsed
the church and kingdom in the tenth century,
was several times brought before the consideration
of the witan, who, both clerical and lay,
were very much divided upon the subject. This
perhaps is a sufficient reason why no formal act of
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was ever passed on the subject, and the
solution of the problem was left to the bishops in
their several cathedrals: but no reader of Saxon
history can be ignorant that it was frequently
brought before the gemót, and that it was the cause
of deep and frequent dissensions among the witan<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c012'><sup>[554]</sup></a>.
The festival days of St. Eádweard and St. Dúnstán
were fixed by the authority of the witan on the 15th
Kal. April and 14th Kal. June respectively<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c012'><sup>[555]</sup></a>; and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>laws contain many provisions for the due keeping
of the Sabbath, and the strict celebration of fasts and
festivals<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c012'><sup>[556]</sup></a>. The levying of church-shots, soul-shots,
light-alms, plough-alms, tithes, and a variety of
other church imposts, the payment of which could
not be otherwise legally binding upon the laity, was
made law by frequently repeated chapters in the
acts of the witan: these are much too numerous to
need specification. They direct the amount to be
paid, the time of payment, and the penalties to be
inflicted on defaulters: nay, they actually direct the
mode in which such payments when received should
be distributed and applied by the receivers<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c012'><sup>[557]</sup></a>. They
establish, as law of the land, the prohibitions to
marry within certain degrees of relationship: and
lastly they adopt and sanction many regulations of
the fathers and bishops, respecting the life and conversation
of priests and deacons, canons, monks
and religious women. On all these points it is
sufficient to give a general reference to the laws,
which are full of regulations even to the minutest
details.</p>

<p class='c001'>8. <em>The king and the witan had power to levy taxes
for the public service.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>I have observed in an earlier chapter of this work
that the estates of the freeman were bound to make
certain settled payments. These may at some time
or other have been voluntary, but there can be no
doubt that they did ultimately become compulsory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>payments. They are the cyninges gafol, payable
on the hide, and may possibly be the cyninges
útware, and cyninges geban of the laws, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>contributions
directes</i></span> by which a man’s station in society
was often measured. Now in the time of Ini, we
find the witan regulating the amount of this tax
or gafol, in barley, at six pounds weight upon the
hide<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c012'><sup>[558]</sup></a>. Again, under the extraordinary circumstances
of the Danish war under Æðelred, when it
became almost customary to buy off the invaders,
we find them authorising the levy of large sums
for that purpose<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c012'><sup>[559]</sup></a>, and also for the maintenance of
fleets<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c012'><sup>[560]</sup></a>: these payments, once known by the name
of Danegeld, and which in 1018 amounted to the
enormous sum of 82,500 pounds<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c012'><sup>[561]</sup></a>, were after thirty-nine
years’ continuance finally abolished by Eádweard<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c012'><sup>[562]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>9. <em>The king and his witan had power to raise land
and sea forces when occasion demanded.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>The king always possessed of himself the right
to call out the ban or armed militia of the freemen:
he also possessed the right of commanding at all
times the service of his comites and their vassals:
but the armed force of the freemen could only be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>kept on foot for a definite period, and probably
within definite limits. It seems therefore that when
the pressure of extraordinary circumstances called
for more than common efforts, and the nation was
to be urged to unusual exertions, the authority of
the witan was added to that of the king; and that
much more extensive levies were made than by
merely calling out the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>hereban</i></span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>landsturm</i></span>. And
this particularly applies to naval armaments, which
were hardly a part of the constitutional force, at
all events not to any great extent<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c012'><sup>[563]</sup></a>. Accordingly
we find in the Chronicle that the king and the
witan commanded armaments to be made against
the Danes in 999, and at the same time directed a
particular service to be sung in the churches. We
learn distinctly from another event that the disposal
of this force depended upon the popular will:
for when Svein, king of the Danes, made application
to Eádweard the Confessor for a naval force
in aid of his war against Magnus of Norway, and
Godwine recommended compliance, we find that it
was refused because Earl Leófríc of Coventry, and
all the people, with one voice opposed it<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c012'><sup>[564]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>10. <em>The witan possessed the power of recommending,
assenting to, and guaranteeing grants of lands,
and of permitting the conversion of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">folcland</span> into
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bócland</span>, and vice versâ.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>With regard to the first part of this assertion, it
will be sufficient to refer to any page of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Diplomaticus Ævi Saxonici</span>: it is impossible almost
to find a single grant in that collection which does
not openly profess to have been made by the king,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum consilio, consensu et licentia procerum,</span>” or
similar expressions. And the necessity for such
consent will appear intelligible when we consider
that these grants must be understood, either to
be direct conversions of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">folcland</span> (fiscal or public
property) into <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bócland</span> (private estates), beneficiary
into hereditary tenure; or, that they contain
licences to free particular lands from the ancient,
customary dues to the state. In both cases the
public revenue, of which king and witan were fiduciary
administrators, was concerned: inasmuch as
nearly every estate, transferred from <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">folcland</span> to
bócland, became just so much withdrawn from the
general stock of ways and means. Only in the
case where lands were literally exchanged from one
category into the other, did the state sustain no
loss. Of this we have evidence in a charter of the
year 858<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c012'><sup>[565]</sup></a>. The king and Wulfláf his thane exchanged
lands in Kent, Æðelberht receiving an
estate of five plough-lands at Mersham and giving
five plough-lands at Wassingwell. The king then
freed the land at Wassingwell in as ample degree
as that at Mersham had been freed; that is, from
every description of service, or impost, except the
three inevitable burthens, of military service, and
repair of fortifications and bridges. And having
done so, he made the land at Mersham, folcland,
i. e., imposed the burthens upon it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>That this is a just view of the powers of the
witan in respect to the folcland, further appears
from instances where the king and the witan, on
one part, as representatives of the nation for that
purpose, make grants to the king in his individual
capacity. In 847, a case of this kind occurred:
Æðelwulf of Wessex obtained twenty hides of land
at Ham, as an estate of inheritance, from his witan<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c012'><sup>[566]</sup></a>.
The words used are very explicit: “I Æðelwulf,
by God’s aid king of the Westsaxons, with the
consent and licence of my bishops and my princes,
have caused a certain small portion of land, consisting
of twenty hides, to be described by its boundaries,
to me, as an estate of inheritance.” And
again: “These are the boundaries of those twenty
hides which Æðelwulf’s senators granted to him
at Ham.” We learn that Offa, king of the Mercians,
had in a similar manner caused one hundred
and ten hides in Kent to be given to him and his
heirs as an estate of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bócland</span><a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c012'><sup>[567]</sup></a>, which he had afterwards
left to the monastery at Bedford. And this
is a peculiarly valuable record, because it was
only by conquest that Offa and his witan could
have obtained a right to dispose of lands beyond
the limits of his own kingdom. Between 901 and
909 the witan of the Westsaxons booked a very
small portion of land to Ælfred’s son Eádweard,
for the site of his monastery at Winchester<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c012'><sup>[568]</sup></a>. In
963 we have another instance: Eádgár caused five
hides to be given him at Peatanige as an estate of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>inheritance. The terms of the document are unusual:
he says, “I <em>have</em> a portion of land,” etc.,
but he frees it from all burthens but the three,
and renders it heritable. The rubric says: “This
is the charter of five hides at Peatanige, which are
Eádgár’s the king’s, during his day and after his
day, to have, or to give to whom it pleaseth him
best<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c012'><sup>[569]</sup></a>.” Again in 964, the same prince gave to his
wife Ælfðrýð ten hides at Aston in Berkshire, as
an estate of inheritance, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">consilio satellitum, pontificum,
comitum, militum<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c012'><sup>[570]</sup></a>.</span>” It is obvious that in
all these cases the grants were made out of public
land, and were not the private estates of the king.</p>

<p class='c001'>11. <em>The witan possessed the power of adjudging
the lands of offenders and intestates to be forfeit to
the king.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>This power applied to <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bócland</span>, as well as <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">folcland</span>,
and was exercised in cases which are by no
means confined to the few enumerated in the laws.
Indeed the latter may very probably refer to nothing
but the chattels or personal property of the
offender; while the real estate might be transferred
to the king, by the solemn act of the witan. A
few examples will make this clear.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ælfred, condemned for treason or rebellion
against Æðelstán, lost his lands by the judgment
of the witan, who bestowed them upon the king<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c012'><sup>[571]</sup></a>.
In 1002 a lady forfeited her lands for her incontinence;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>the king became seised of them, obviously
by the act of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span>, for he calls it <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vulgaris traditio</i></span><a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c012'><sup>[572]</sup></a>.
Again, the lands of certain people which
had been forfeited for theft, are described as having
been granted to the king, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">iusto valde iudicio
totius populi, seniorum et primatum</span><a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c012'><sup>[573]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The case of intestacy is proved by a charter of
Ecgberht in 825. He gave fifteen hides at Aulton
to Winchester, and made title in these words.
“Now this land, a very faithful reeve of mine called
Burghard formerly possessed by my grant: but he
afterwards dying childless, left the land without a
will, and he had no survivors: and so the land
with all its boundaries was restored to me, its former
possessor, by judicial decree of my <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>optimates</i></span><a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c012'><sup>[574]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Other examples may be found in the quotations
given in page 52 of this volume; to which I may
add a case of forfeiture for suicide<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c012'><sup>[575]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>12. <em>Lastly, the witan acted as a supreme court
of justice, both in civil and criminal causes.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>The fact of important trials being decided by the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> is obvious from a very numerous list
of charters recording the result of such trials, and
printed in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Diplomaticus</span>. It is perfectly
unnecessary to give examples; they occur continually
in the pages of that work. The documents
are in great detail, giving the names of the parties,
the heads of the case, sometimes the very steps in
the trial, and always recording the place and date
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>of the gemót, and the names of those who presided
therein.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proceedings of the witan as a court of criminal
jurisprudence, are well exemplified in the
case of earl Godwine and his family daring their
patriotic struggle for power with the foreign minions
of Eádweard, and the northern earls, the hereditary
enemies of their house. Eustace the count of Boulogne,
then on a visit to Eádweard, having with
a small armed retinue attempted violence against
some of the inhabitants of Dover, was set upon
by the townsmen, and after a severe loss hardly
succeeded in making his escape. He hastened to
Gloucester, where Eádweard then held his court,
and laid his complaint before the king. Godwine,
as earl of Kent, was commanded to set out with his
forces, and inflict summary punishment upon the
burghers who had dared to maltreat a relative of
the king. But the stern old statesman saw matters
in a very different light: he probably found
no reason to punish the inhabitants of one of his
best towns, for an act of self defence, especially one
which had read a severe lesson to the foreign adventurers,
who abused the weakness of an incapable
prince, and domineered over the land. He therefore
flatly refused, and withdrew from Gloucester
to join his sons Harald and Swegen who lay at
Beverston and Langtree with a considerable power.
The king being reinforced by a well-appointed contingent
from the northern earldoms, affairs threatened
to be brought to a bloody termination. The
conduct of Godwine and his family had been represented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>to Eádweard in the most unfavourable colours,
and the demand they made that the obnoxious
strangers should be given up to them, only aggravated
his deep resentment. However for a time
peace was maintained, hostages were given on
either side, and a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> was proclaimed,
to meet in London, at the end of a fortnight, September
21st, 1048. On the arrival of the earls in
Southwark, they found that a greatly superior force
from the commands of Leofríc, Sigeward and
Raulf awaited them: desertion thinned their numbers,
and when the king demanded back his hostages,
they were compelled to comply. Godwine and
Harald were now summoned to appear before the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> and make answer to what should be brought
against them. They demanded, though probably
with little expectation of obtaining, a safe conduct
to and from the gemót, which was refused;
and as they very properly declined under such circumstances
to appear, five days were allowed them
to leave England altogether.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is probable that the strictly legal forms were
followed on this occasion, although the composition
of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was such that justice could not
have been done. The same observation will apply
to another <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> holden in London, after
Godwine’s triumphant return to England, though
with a very different result. Before this assembly
the earl appeared, easily cleared himself of all
offences laid to his charge, and obtained the outlawry
and banishment from England of all the
Frenchmen whose pernicious councils had put dissension
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>between the king and his people. Other
examples might be given of outlawry, and even
heavier sentences, as blinding, if not death, pronounced
by the high court of the witan. But as
these are all the result of internal dissensions, they
resemble rather the violence of impeachments by
an irresistible majority, than the calm, impassive
judgments of a judicial assembly<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c012'><sup>[576]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such were the powers of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span>, and
it must be confessed that they were extensive. Of
the manner of the deliberations or the forms of
business we know little, but it is not likely that
they were very complicated. We may conclude
that the general outline of the proceedings was
something of the following order. On common
occasions the king summoned his witan to attend
him at some royal vill, at Christmas, or at Easter,
for festive and ceremonial as well as business purposes.
On extraordinary occasions he issued summonses
according to the nature of the exigency,
appointing the time and place of meeting. When
assembled, the witan commenced their session by
attending divine service<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c012'><sup>[577]</sup></a>, and formally professing
their adherence to the catholic faith<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c012'><sup>[578]</sup></a>. The king
then brought his propositions before them, in the
Frankish manner<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c012'><sup>[579]</sup></a>, and after due deliberation they
were accepted, modified, or rejected. The reeves,
and perhaps on occasion officers specially designated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>for that service<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c012'><sup>[580]</sup></a>, carried the chapters down
into the several counties, and there took a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wed</i></span> or
pledge from the freemen that they would abide by
what had been enacted. This last fact, important
to us in more respects than one, is substantiated
by the following evidence. Toward the close of
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Judicia Civitatis Londoniae</span> (cap. 10), passed in
the reign of Æðelstán, and subsidiary to the acts
of various <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemóts</span> held by him, we find:—“All
the witan gave their pledges together to the archbishop
at Thundersfield, when Ælfheáh Stybb and
Brihtnóð, Odda’s son, came to meet the gemót
by the king’s command, that each reeve should
take the pledge in his own shire, that they would
all hold the frið, as king Æðelstán and the witan
had counselled it, first at Greátanleá, and again
at Exeter, and afterwards at Feversham, and the
fourth time at Thundersfield,” etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have also a very remarkable document addressed
to the same king, apparently upon receipt
of the acts of the council at Feversham, by the
men of Kent, denoting their acceptance of the
same. They commence by saying:—“Dearest!
Thy bishops of Kent, and all the thanes of Kentshire,
earls and churls<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c012'><sup>[581]</sup></a>, return thanks to thee their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>dearest lord, for what thou hast been pleased to
ordain respecting our peace, and to enquire and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>consult concerning our advantage, since great was
the need thereof for us all, both rich and poor.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>And this we have taken in hand, with all the diligence
we could, by the aid of those witan [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sapientes</i></span>]
whom thou didst send unto us,” etc<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c012'><sup>[582]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is plain from the preceding passage that the
witan gave their <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wed</i></span> to observe, and cause to
be observed, the laws they had enacted<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c012'><sup>[583]</sup></a>. Eádgár
says, “I command my <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span>, upon my friendship,
and by all they possess, to punish every one
that will not perform this, and who by any neglect
shall break the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wed</i></span> of my witan.” This seems to
imply that the people were generally bound by the
acts of the witan, and their pledge or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wed</i></span>; and if
it were so, it would naturally involve the theory of
representation. But this deduction will not stand.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole principle of Teutonic legislation is,
and always was, that the law is made by the constitution
of the king, and the consent of the people<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c012'><sup>[584]</sup></a>:
and we have seen one way in which that
consent was obtained, viz. by sending the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>capitula</i></span>
down into the provinces or shires, and taking the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wed</i></span> in the shiremoot. The passage in the text
seems to presuppose an interchange of oaths and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>pledges between the king and witan themselves;
and even those who had no standing of their own
in the folcmót or scírgemót, were required to be
bound by <em>personal</em> consent. The lord was just as
much commanded to take oath and pledge of his
several dependents (the hired men, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>familiares</i></span>, or
people of his household), as the sheriff was required
to take them of the free shire-thanes<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c012'><sup>[585]</sup></a>. Of course
this excludes all idea of representation in our modern
sense of the word, because with us, promulgation
by the Parliament is sufficient, and the constituent
is bound without any further ceremony by
the act of him whom he has sent in his own place.
But the Teutons certainly did not elect their representatives
as we elect ours, with full power to judge,
decide for, and bind us, and therefore it was right
and necessary that the laws when made should be
duly ratified and accepted by all the people.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the dignified clergy, the ealdormen
and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span>, and the þegnas both in counties and
boroughs, appear to have constituted the witena
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> properly so called, there is still reason to
suppose that the people themselves, or some of
them, were very often present. In fact a system
gradually framed as I suppose that of our forefathers
to have been, and indebted very greatly to
accident for its form, must have possessed a very
considerable elasticity. The people who were in
the neighbourhood, who happened to be collected
in arms during a sitting of the witan, or who
thought it worth while to attend their meeting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>were very probably allowed to do so, and to exercise
at least a right of conclamation<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c012'><sup>[586]</sup></a>,—a right which
must daily become rarer, as the freemen gradually
disappeared, and the number of landowners, dependent
upon and represented by lords, as rapidly
increased. In conclusion a few passages may be
cited, which seem to render it probable that the
people, when on the spot, did take some part in
the business, as I have already mentioned with
respect to the Frankish levies in the Campus <a id='corr238.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Ma ius'>Madius</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_238.10'><ins class='correction' title='Ma ius'>Madius</ins></a></span>
of Charlemagne. But it must also be borne in
mind that such a case ought to be looked upon as
accidental, rather than necessary, and that a meeting
of the witan did not require the formality of
an acceptance by the people on the spot, to render
its acts obligatory. It was enough that the thanes
of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> should pass, and the thanes of the scír
accept the law. Indeed it could not be otherwise;
for as the heads of all the more important social
aggregations of the free, and the lords whose men
were represented by them even in courts of justice,
were the members of the gemót, their decisions
must have been, strictly considered, the real decisions
of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>populus</i></span>, or franchise-bearing people.</p>

<p class='c001'>Beda, relating the discussion which took place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>respecting the celebration of Easter, and which was
held in the presence of Oswiu and Alhfrið of Northumberland,
and Wilfrið’s successful defence of the
Roman custom, adds: “When the king had said
these words, all who sat or stood around assented:
and abandoning the less perfect institution, they
hastened to adopt what they recognized as a better
one<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c012'><sup>[587]</sup></a>.” Again the deposition of Sigeberht is stated
to have taken place in an assembly of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>proceres</i></span>
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>populus</i></span>, the princes and people of the whole
realm<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c012'><sup>[588]</sup></a>. A doubtful charter of Ini, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 725, is
said to be consented to “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum praesentia populationis</span><a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c012'><sup>[589]</sup></a>,”
by which words are meant either the witan
or the people of Wessex. In 804 Æðelríc’s title-deeds
were confirmed before a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> at Clofesho:
the charter recites that archbishop Æðelheard gave
judgment, with the witness of king Cóenwulf and
his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>optimates</i></span>, before all the synod or meeting:
whence it is clear that others were present besides
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>optimates</i></span> or witan strictly so called<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c012'><sup>[590]</sup></a>. On the
28th of May 924 a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was held at Winchester,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tota populi generalitate,</span>” as the charter witnesses<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c012'><sup>[591]</sup></a>,
and in 931 another at Worðig, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tota plebis
generalitate<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c012'><sup>[592]</sup></a>.</span>” Æðelstán in 938 declares that
certain lands had been forfeited for theft, by the
just judgment of all the people, <em>and</em> the Seniores
and Primates; and that the original charters were
cancelled by a decree of all the people<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c012'><sup>[593]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>But whether expressions of this kind were intended
to denote the actual presence of the people
on the spot; or whether <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>populus</i></span> is used in a strict
and technical sense—that sense which is confined
to those who enjoy the full franchise, those who
form part of the πολιτευμα,—or finally whether the
assembly of the witan making laws is considered to
represent in our modern form an assembly of the
whole people,—it is clear that the power of self-government
is recognized in the latter.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to facilitate reference to the important
facts with which this chapter deals, I have added to
it a list of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemóts</span>, with here and there a
few remarks upon the business transacted in them.
They do not nearly exhaust the number that must
have been held, but still they form a respectable
body of evidence; and we may perhaps be justly
surprised, not that so little, but that so much has
survived. We need not lament that the present
forms and powers of our parliament are not those
which existed a thousand years ago, as long as we
recognize in them only the matured development
of an old and useful principle. We shall not appeal
to Anglosaxon custom to justify the various points
of the Charter; but we may still be proud to find
in their practice the germ of institutions which
we have, throughout all vicissitudes, been taught
to cherish as the most valuable safeguards of our
peace as well as our freedom. Truly there are few
nations whose parliamentary history has so ample
a foundation as our own.</p>

  <h4 class='c023'>THE WITENA GEMÓTS OF THE SAXONS.</h4>
</div>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELBERT OF KENT, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 596-605.—The promulgation
of the laws of Æðelberht took place during
the life of Augustine. This fixes their date between 596,
when he arrived in England, and 605, when he died. Beda
tells us that these laws were enacted by the advice of the
witan, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum consilio sapientium</span><a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c012'><sup>[594]</sup></a>.” We may therefore
conclude that a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was held in Kent for the purpose:
and from the contents of the laws themselves, it is obvious
that the Roman clergy filled an important place
therein. They had probably stepped into the position of
the Pagan priesthood, and improved it.</p>

<p class='c015'>EÁDUUINI OF NORTHUMBERLAND, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 627.—The
first <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> of which we have any detailed
record was holden in 627, near the city of York, wherein
no less important business was discussed than the desertion
of Paganism and reception of Christianity, by the people
of Northumberland. From Beda<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c012'><sup>[595]</sup></a> we learn that this step
was not ventured without the gravest deliberation; and
that Eáduuini had taken good care to sound the most influential
of his nobles, before he called a public meeting to
decide upon the question. Indeed the parts in this great
drama appear to have been arranged beforehand. The interesting
account given by Beda<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c012'><sup>[596]</sup></a> is to this effect. Eáduuini
had determined to embrace Christianity, but still he was
not contented, or would not venture, to do this alone.
He wished to extend the blessings of the new faith to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>subjects; perhaps also to avoid the difficulties which might
result from his conversion, while the rest of the people remained
pagans. To the exhortations of the missionary
Paulinus he rejoined, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">suscipere quidem se fidem quam
docebat, et velle, et debere ... verum adhuc cum amicis,
principibus et consiliariis suis, sese de hoc collaturum esse
dicebat; ut si illi eadem cum illo sentire vellent, omnes
pariter in fonte vitae Christo consecrarentur. Et annuente
Paulino, fecit ut dixerat. Habito enim cum sapientibus
consilio, sciscitabatur singillatim ab omnibus, qualis
sibi doctrina haec eatenus inaudita, et novus divinitatis
qui praedicabatur cultus videretur.</span>” The chief of his
priests, Cóefi, immediately commenced an attack upon the
ancient religion, and was followed by other nobles, one of
whose speeches, the earliest specimen of English parliamentary
eloquence, is yet on record<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c012'><sup>[597]</sup></a>. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">His similia et caeteri
maiores natu ac regis consiliarii, divinitus admoniti,
prosequebantur.</span>” Paulinus was now invited to expound
at greater length the doctrines which he recommended.
At the close of his address Cóefi declared himself a convert,
and proposed the destruction of the ancient fanes.
Eáduuini now professed himself a Christian, and in turn
demanded whose duty it was to profane the pagan altars.
This Cóefi at once assumed to himself, and taking the
most conspicuous means to demonstrate to the people
(who, the historian says, thought him mad,) his apostasy
from the old creed, hurled his lance into the sacred enclosure,
and commanded its immediate destruction. The
scene of this daring act was Godmundingahám, not far
from the British Delgovitia, and now Godmundham or
Goodmanham. The king then as speedily as possible,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">citato opere</span>,” built a wooden basilica in the city of York,
in which he was solemnly baptized on the twelfth of April,
being Easter-day. And thus, says the historian, Eáduuini
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>became a Christian, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum cunctis gentis suae nobilibus ac
plebe perplurima<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c012'><sup>[598]</sup></a>.</span>”</p>

<p class='c015'>WULFHARI OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 657.—In this year
a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> was probably held for the endowment and
consecration of Saxwulf’s monastery at Peterborough.
This the king is stated to have done by the advice, and
with the consent, of all the witan of his kingdom, both
clerical and lay<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c012'><sup>[599]</sup></a>. The charter in the Saxon Chronicle
is a late forgery, but throws no well-grounded doubt upon
the fact.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÓSUUIU OF NORTHUMBERLAND, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 662.—A
meeting was held this year at Streoneshalh, to bring
about uniformity of Paschal observance, tonsure, and other
ecclesiastical details. It was presided over by Osuuiu and
Alhfrið<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c012'><sup>[600]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ECGBERHT OF KENT, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 667.—A <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was
probably held in Kent, and Wighard was elected archbishop
of Canterbury<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c012'><sup>[601]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ARCHBISHOP THEODORE, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 673.—In this
year was held the synod or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> of Hertford<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c012'><sup>[602]</sup></a>. Beda has
preserved its ecclesiastical acts. The seventh provision is
an important one, viz. that similar meetings should be held
twice in every year. But this appearing inconvenient, it
was agreed that there should be one, on the first of August
yearly at Clofeshoas.</p>

<p class='c015'>ARCHBISHOP THEODORE, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 680.—In this
year was held the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> at Hǽðfeld, in the presence of
the kings of Northumberland, Mercia, Eastanglia and
Kent. Its ecclesiastical acts are preserved<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c012'><sup>[603]</sup></a>: they are particularly
directed against the heresy of Eutyches. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>there was a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> at the same time probably to
sanction the decision of the clergy.</p>

<p class='c015'>ECGFRIÐ OF NORTHUMBERLAND, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 684.—There
was a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> at Twyford, on the river Alne, and
Cúðberht was elected bishop of Hexham<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c012'><sup>[604]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELRED OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 685.—A <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was
held on the thirtieth of July at Berhford, now Burford in
Gloucestershire. Berhtwald the subregulus and Æðelred
were probably both present<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c012'><sup>[605]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>WIHTRAED OF KENT, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 696.—Immediately
upon Wihtraed’s accession<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c012'><sup>[606]</sup></a> he held a great council, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mycel
consilium</span>,” or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> of his witan, to settle the ecclesiastical
and secular difficulties which had arisen during the civil
wars of his predecessors and his own struggle for the
throne. The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was held at Beorganstede, now Berstead
in Kent. Its acts are extant in the laws which yet
go under Wihtraed’s name<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c012'><sup>[607]</sup></a>. Another <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> of Wihtraed’s,
said by the Chronicle<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c012'><sup>[608]</sup></a> to have been held in 694 at
Baccanceld, now Bapchild, in Kent, confirmed the liberties
of the Kentish clergy.</p>

<p class='c015'>INI OF WESSEX, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 704.—A <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> was
held by Ini at Eburleáh, in which, with the consent of
his witan, he gave certain privileges to the monasteries of
Wessex<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c012'><sup>[609]</sup></a>. Its acts were signed by the principes, senatores,
iudices and patricii present. We learn also from a charter
of Aldhelm<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c012'><sup>[610]</sup></a>, that before 705, a council had been held
upon the banks of the river Woder, which is possibly the
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">synodus suae gentis</span>” mentioned by Beda<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c012'><sup>[611]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>ÓSRAED OF NORTHUMBERLAND, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 705.—Upon
the death of Aldfrið in 705, a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was held upon
the banks of the Nidd, and after long debates bishop Wilfrið
was restored to his see and possessions<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c012'><sup>[612]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 710.—In this year a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> appears to have been
held, in which Sussex was erected into a separate see, and
severed from the diocese of Winchester<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c012'><sup>[613]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ARCHBISHOP NÓÐHELM, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 734-737.—Difficulties
having arisen about the possession and patronage
of certain monasteries, the case was referred to and decided
by a synod, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sancta sacerdotalis concilii synodus,</span>” which
must have met between 734-737. It seems to have been
purely ecclesiastical, and its acts are signed only by the
bishops who were present<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c012'><sup>[614]</sup></a>. Yet as its judgment involved
a question of property, and title to lands, I presume that
the case was laid before a mixed gemót, sitting very possibly
in different chambers. If so, the record we have is
that of the clerical house only.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELBALD OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 742.—In this year
a great council, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum concilium,</span>” was held at Clofeshoas,
under Æðelbald, and Cúðbeorht, archbishop of Canterbury.
It took into consideration the state of the church;
but it was clearly a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span>, and its acts are signed
by clerks and laymen indifferently<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c012'><sup>[615]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELBALD OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 749.—A witena
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was held at Godmundes leáh in this year. Ecclesiastical
liberties were again provided for<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c012'><sup>[616]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 755.—A <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> in Wessex must have been

of Cynewulf to the throne<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c012'><sup>[617]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>OFFA OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 780.—A <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> called

It transacted various business of a secular character<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c012'><sup>[618]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 782.—A <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was held at Acleáh, now Ockley in

<p class='c015'>OFFA OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 785.—In this year was

of Canterbury was partitioned; and the archbishopric of
Lichfield founded<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c012'><sup>[620]</sup></a>. It was clearly a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span>; as

meeting.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 787.—In this year there was another <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span>; “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">synodalis

business was transacted<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c012'><sup>[625]</sup></a>. In the second document cited
in the note it is called “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontificale conciliabulum</span>,” and

plain proof that the word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>synodus</i></span> is not confined to ecclesiastical
meetings. Another, or perhaps the same, at
Baccanceld, Bapchild, in Kent, where the clergy made a
declaration of liberties<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c012'><sup>[633]</sup></a>. Another and very solemn one at
Clofeshoas<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c012'><sup>[634]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>CÉNWULF OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 799.—A <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> of
the witan was held this year at Colleshyl, probably Coleshill
in Berkshire<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c012'><sup>[635]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>CÉNWULF OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 799-802.—Between
these two years there was a gemót, called “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">synodale conciliabulum,</span>”
at Cealchýð, in which secular business was
transacted. The signature of the king to one of its acts is
double; first at the head of the clergy, and then again at
the head of the lay nobles<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c012'><sup>[636]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>CÉNWULF OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 803.—In the year
803 was held a memorable synod at Clofeshoas, which
lasted from the ninth till the twelfth of October. Affairs of
great importance were discussed. The principal object of
the meeting was to restore the ancient splendour of Canterbury
by the abrogation of the archiepiscopal see at Lichfield,
and further to secure the liberties of the church. We
have two solemn acts, dated on the twelfth of October<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c012'><sup>[637]</sup></a>: the
signatures are exclusively those of clerics. The second of
those documents deserves the highest attention, as the signatures
may be taken to represent the members of a full convocation
of the clergy, called for a most important purpose.
But it is nevertheless certain that a general meeting of the
witan took place at the same time, for on the sixth of October
they heard and determined causes relating to landed
property, and various laymen signed the acts<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c012'><sup>[638]</sup></a>. Moreover
an archbishopric established by a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> could only
be abrogated by another,—not by a mere assemblage of
clergymen, however dignified and influential they might
be.</p>

<p class='c015'>CÉNWULF OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 804.—There was a
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">synodus</span>” in this year at Clofeshoas, the nature of the business
transacted in which and before whom transacted,
appears from these words following<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c012'><sup>[639]</sup></a>:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anno ab incarnatione
Christi 804, indictione duodecima, ego Æðelríc filius
Æðelmundi cum conscientia synodali invitatus ad synodum,
et in iudicio stare, in loco qui dicitur Clofeshoh, cum
libris et ruris, id est, æt Westmynster, quod prius propinqui
mei tradiderunt mihi et donaverunt, ibi Æðelheardus
archiepiscopus mihi regebat atque iudicaverat, cum testimonio

terram meam atque libellos dare quocumque volui.</span>” He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>had been regularly summoned to appear before the synodus,
as a court of justice.</p>

<p class='c015'>CÉNWULF OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 805.—A witena
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was held at Ockley, a favourite locality<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c012'><sup>[640]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>CÉNWULF OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 810.—Another <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span>,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sancta synodus,</span>” sat at Ockley, and decided a lawsuit
between Æðelhelm, and Beornðryð, the widow of Óswulf,
duke of Kent<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c012'><sup>[641]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>CÉNWULF OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 811.—A great gemót,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">concilium pergrande,</span>” was held this year in London<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c012'><sup>[642]</sup></a>.
In the same year a great <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was collected at Wincelcumbe,
Winchcomb in Gloucestershire, for the dedication
of Cénwulf’s new abbey there<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c012'><sup>[643]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>CÉNWULF OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 815.—In this year
a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> assembled at Cealchýð<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c012'><sup>[644]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>BEORNWULF OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 824.—At a
meeting held this year at Clofeshoas, there attended a
considerable number of laymen, as well as prelates: the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> however is called “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontificate et synodale conciliabulum</span><a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c012'><sup>[645]</sup></a>.”
In 824 there was also a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> of Wessex at
Ockley in Surrey. Ecgberht gave Meon to Wulfward his
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praefectus</span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>. The act is signed by four <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfan</span><a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c012'><sup>[646]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>BEORNWULF OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 825.—A gemót
was held also at Clofeshoas in 825; this is called “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sionoðlíc
gemót</span>”<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c012'><sup>[647]</sup></a>, and it is stated that there were assembled the
bishops, ealdormen, and all the weotan of the nation: one
act of this <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span><a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c012'><sup>[648]</sup></a> declares it to have consisted of the king,
bishops, abbots, dukes, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omniumque dignitatum optimates,
aecclesiasticarum vel saecularium personarum</span><a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c012'><sup>[649]</sup></a>.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>The acts of this council are signed by no less than one
hundred and twenty-one persons, of whom ninety-five are
clerical, embracing all ranks from bishops to deacons.
But one reason for this large attendance is, that as some
cases of disputed title were to be decided by the gemót,
these monks and clerks attended in order to make oath to
the property in dispute.</p>

<p class='c015'>ECGBERHT OF WESSEX, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 826.—In 825 Ecgberht
had taken the field against the Welsh. He seems
to have made various grants while <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in hoste</i></span>. These were
afterwards confirmed and reduced to writing by a gemót
held in 826 at Southampton<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c012'><sup>[650]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ECGBERHT OF WESSEX and ÆÐELWULF OF
KENT, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 838.—In this year there was a council at
Kingston, under these kings, Ceólnóð the archbishop, and
the prelates of his province. Secular affairs of great importance
were settled on this occasion, and a regular treaty
of peace and alliance agreed between the Kentish clergy
and the kings<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c012'><sup>[651]</sup></a>. At first this was signed only by Ceólnóð
and the clergy; but for further confirmation it was taken
to king Æðelwulf at the royal vill of Wilton, and there
executed by the king, his dukes and thanes. Another
document exists in which the clergy of Winchester enter
into similar engagements with the kings<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c012'><sup>[652]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELWULF OF WESSEX, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 839.—The treaty
mentioned in the last article was read in a council of all
the southern bishops, held at Astra<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c012'><sup>[653]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELWULF OF WESSEX, ÆÐELSTÁN OF
KENT, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 844.—A <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> at Canterbury, attended by
the kings, the archbishop, the bishop elect of Rochester,
“cum principibus, ducibus, abbatibus, et cunctis generalis
dignitatis optimatibus<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c012'><sup>[654]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELWULF OF WESSEX, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 851.—The very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>questionable authority of Ingulph mentions a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span>
this year at Cyningesbyrig<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c012'><sup>[655]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>BURHHRED OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 853.—This year,
the Chronicle says<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c012'><sup>[656]</sup></a>, a formal application was made by
the Mercian king Burhhred and his witan for military
aid, in order to the subjugation of the Northern Britons.
This seems to imply a regular meeting in Mercia.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELWULF OF WESSEX, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 855.—In this year
there was a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> at Winchester<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c012'><sup>[657]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>BURHHRED OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 868.—In this year
the Mercian witan applied to those of Wessex for aid
against the Danes. We may conclude that <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemóts</span> were
held both in Mercia and Wessex<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c012'><sup>[658]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 866-871.—We learn from king Ælfred himself that
there was a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> at Swínbeorh in some year between
these limits, wherein the successions to lands,
among the members of the royal family, were settled, and
placed under the guarantee of the witan<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c012'><sup>[659]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>ÆLFRED OF WESSEX, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 878.—In this year
there was a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span>, very probably at Wedmore<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c012'><sup>[660]</sup></a>, where
the Dane Guðorm made his submission to Ælfred, and
where the articles of peace between the Saxons and Danes
were settled<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c012'><sup>[661]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆLFRED OF WESSEX, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 880-885.—A <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span>
sat at Langandene between these two years, and the affairs
of Ælfred’s family were again considered. The validity of
king Æðelwulf’s will was admitted, and Ælfred’s settlement
of his lands guaranteed<a href='#f659' class='c012'><sup>[659]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELRED, DUKE OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 883.—In
this year the witan of Mercia met at Risborough, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Æðelred their duke<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c012'><sup>[662]</sup></a>: an interesting circumstance, inasmuch
as it shows that the union with Wessex did not abrogate
the ancient rights, or interfere with the independent
action of the Mercian witan.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELRED, DUKE OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 888.—This
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was held at Saltwíc in Worcestershire, to consult
upon affairs both ecclesiastical and secular. The witan
assembled from far and near<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c012'><sup>[663]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELRED, DUKE OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 896.—Another
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> of the Mercians was held this year at Gloucester,
whose interesting acts are yet preserved<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c012'><sup>[664]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELRED, DUKE OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 878-899.—At
a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> held between these years, and very likely at
Worcester, Æðelred and Æðelflǽd commanded a burh or
fortification to be built for the people of that city, and the
cathedral to be enlarged. The endowments and privileges
which are granted by the instrument are extensive and
instructive<a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c012'><sup>[665]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>EÁDWEARD OF WESSEX, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 901.—The death
of Ælfred, and Eádweard’s election probably caused an
assembly of witan at Winchester in this year<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c012'><sup>[666]</sup></a>, and it is
likely that we still possess one of its acts<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c012'><sup>[667]</sup></a>. This is the
more probable because Æðelwald, Eádweard’s cousin, disputed
the succession, and not only seized upon the royal
vill of Wimborne, which he is said to have done without
the consent of the king and his witan, but broke into open
rebellion, and after being acknowledged king in Essex,
joined the Danes in Northumberland, and perished in an
unsuccessful battle against his countrymen.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELRED, DUKE OF MERCIA, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 904.—In
this year a Mercian <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was held, and duke Æðelfrið
obtained permission to have new charters written, his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>having perished by fire<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c012'><sup>[668]</sup></a>. And a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> of the Westsaxon
witan was held at the king’s hunting-seat of Bicanleáh<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c012'><sup>[669]</sup></a>.
About the same period a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> of Wessex was held at
Exeter by Eádweard<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c012'><sup>[670]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>EÁDWEARD OF WESSEX, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 909.—A <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> of
Wessex was held in 909: its acts are signed by fifty of
the witan<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c012'><sup>[671]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>EÁDWEARD OF WESSEX, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 910.—A <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span>
was held in Wessex this year<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c012'><sup>[672]</sup></a>. And there appears to have
been another at Aylesford in Kent, in which the witan
gave judgment in the suit between Góda and queen
Eádgyfu<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c012'><sup>[673]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>EÁDWEARD OF WESSEX, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 911.—In this year
a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was probably held, in which terms of peace were
offered to the Danes in Northumberland<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c012'><sup>[674]</sup></a>. But this may
possibly be only the last-named <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> in 910, as we know
that Eádweard was in Kent in 911.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELSTÁN, <span class='fss'>A.D</span>. 925 or 926.—About this date a
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was held by Æðelstán at Ham near Lewes, and the
suit between Góda and Eádgyfu was again decided by
public authority<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c012'><sup>[675]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELSTÁN, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 928.—A solemn <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was held
this year at Exeter<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c012'><sup>[676]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELSTÁN, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 930.—In this year the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> met
at Nottingham. It was attended by three Welsh princes,
the archbishops and sixteen bishops, thirteen dukes, twelve
thanes, twelve untitled persons, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et plures alii milites quorum
nomina in eadem carta inseruntur.</span>” There are fifty-eight
signatures<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c012'><sup>[677]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>ÆÐELSTÁN, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 931.—In this year several <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemóts</span>
were held. First, one at Luton in Bedfordshire, signed
by 106 persons<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c012'><sup>[678]</sup></a>. One at Worðig, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum tota plebis generalitate</span><a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c012'><sup>[679]</sup></a>.”
One at Colchester<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c012'><sup>[680]</sup></a>, and one at Wellow in
Wilts<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c012'><sup>[681]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELSTÁN, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 932.—There was a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> at Amesbury,
said to be attended by the dukes, bishops, abbots and
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">patriae procuratores</span>”<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c012'><sup>[682]</sup></a>. Also one at Middleton, in which
the same words occur: the signatures amount to ninety,
and comprise four Welsh princes, nineteen archbishops
and bishops, fifteen dukes, four abbots, and forty-seven
ministri or thanes<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c012'><sup>[683]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELSTÁN, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 934.—A <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> was held in London
on the seventh of June<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c012'><sup>[684]</sup></a>; but on the twenty-eighth of
May there was a great meeting at Winchester, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tota

Again on the twelfth of September, the king was at
Buckingham, and there held a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span>, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tota magnatorum

<p class='c015'>ÆÐELSTÁN, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 935.—On the twenty-first of September
in this year there was a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemót</span> at Dorchester, “tota

<p class='c001'>An undated charter of Æðelstán<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c012'><sup>[689]</sup></a> records a meeting of

archbishop, bishops and abbots present solemnly excommunicated
any one who should disturb the grant; to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>all the people present exclaimed, “So be it! Amen.” “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et

somewhere in the hundred of that name in the county of Gloucester,
and therefore not far from Deerhurst, Tewksbury and Bishop’s Cleeve;
not at all improbably in Tewksbury itself, which may have been called

<p class='c001'><a href='#r484'>484</a>. The establishment of the Scabini or Schöffen in the Frankish empire
was intended to relieve the freemen from the inconvenience of
attending <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gemóts</span>, which the counts converted into an engine of extortion
and oppression.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f485'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r485'>485</a>. It has always been a question of deep interest in this country, what
persons were entitled to attend the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Gemót</span>: and in truth very important
constitutional doctrines depend upon the answer we give to it. The
very first and most essential condition of truth appears to me, that we
firmly close our eyes to everything derived from the custom of Parliaments,
under the Norman, the Angevine or the English kings: the
practice of a nation governed by the principles of Feudal law, is totally
irreconcileable with the old system of personal relations which existed
under the earlier Teutonic law. The next most important thing is, that
we use no words but such as the Saxons themselves used: the moment
we begin to talk of Tenants in capite, Vavassors, Vassals, and so forth,
we introduce terms which may involve a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>petitio principii</i></span>, and must
lead to associations of ideas tending to an erroneous conclusion. One
of these fallacies appears to me to lie in the assertion that a landed
qualification was required for a member of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena gemót</span>. One of
the most brilliant, if not the most accurate, commentators on our constitutional
history, Sir F. Palgrave, has raised this question. According
to his view no one could be a member of that singular body which he
supposes the Anglosaxon Parliament to have been, unless he had forty
híds of land, four thousand acres at least according to the popular doctrine.
But this whole supposition rests upon a series of fine-drawn
conclusions, in my opinion, without sound foundation, and totally inconsistent
with every feeling and habit of Saxon society. The monkish
writer of the history of Ely—a very late and generally ill-informed
authority—says that a lady would not marry some suitor of hers, because
not having forty híds he could not be counted among the Proceres;
and this is the whole basis of this parliamentary theory,—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>proceres</i></span>
being assumed, without the slightest reason, to mean members of
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span>,—and the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> to be some royal council,
some Curia Regis, and not at all the kind of body described in this
chapter. I confess I cannot realize to myself the notion of an Anglosaxon
woman nourishing the ambition of seeing her husband a member
of Parliament. The passage no doubt implies that a certain amount
of land was necessary to entitle a man to be classed in a certain high
rank in society: and this becomes probable enough as we find a landed
qualification partially insisted on with regard to the ceorl who aspired
to be ranked as a thane. But this is a negative condition altogether:
it is intended to repress the pretensions of those who, in spite of their
ceorlish birth, assumed the weapons and would, if possible, have assumed
the rights of thanes. In the Saxon custumal, called “Ranks,”
it is said:—“And if a thane throve so that he became an eorl, he was
thenceforth worthy of eorl-right.” Thorpe, i. 192. On this the learned
editor of the Ancient Laws and Institutes observes:—“It is to this law
that the historian of Ely seems to allude in the following passage, and
not to any qualification for a seat in the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span>, as has been so
frequently asserted. ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Habuit (sc. Wulfricus abbas) enim fratrem Gudmundum
vocabulo, cui filiam praepotentis viri in matrimonium coniungi
paraverat, sed quoniam ille quadraginta hidarum terrae dominium minime
obtineret, licet nobilis esset</span> [that is, a thane] <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter proceres tunc
nominari non potuit, eum puella repudiavit.</span>’ Gale, ii. c. 40. If we
refer to the Dooms of Cnut, c. 69, we shall see that the heriots of an
eorl and of a lesser thane were in the proportion of from one to eight,—a
rule which may have been supposed to have arisen from a somewhat
similar relation between the quantities of their respective estates;
and as the possession of five hides conferred upon a ceorl the rights of
a thane, the possession of forty (5 × 8) in all probability raised a thane
to the dignity of an eorl.” This opinion is only a confirmation of that
which I had myself formed on similar grounds long before Mr. Thorpe’s
work was published: and it was apparently so understood by Phillips
before either of us wrote. See Angels. Recht. p. 114, note 317, Göttingen,
1825.</p>

while England was full of kinglets, disputes were not infrequent.
Northumberland and Wessex (previous to Beorhtríc’s alliance

and the witan themselves split into parties, generally maintaining the
interests of <em>different</em> royal families.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f580'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r580'>580</a>. The Franks and the church were familiar with such officers, who
under the name of <em>Missi</em> were dispatched into the provinces for special
purposes. Perhaps the Ælfheáh and Brihtnóð mentioned in the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Judicia Civitatis</span> were the Missi who were to be employed on this
commission.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f581'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r581'>581</a>. Mr. Hallam, in his Supplemental Notes, p. 229, remarks upon this
important document: “It is moreover an objection to considering this
a formal enactment by the witan of the shire, that it runs in the names
of ‘thaini, comites et villani.’ Can it be maintained that the ceorls
ever formed an integrant element of the legislature in the kingdom of
Kent? It may be alleged that their name was inserted, though they
had not been formally consenting parties, as we find in some parliamentary
grants of money much later. But this would be an arbitrary
conjecture, and the terms ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnes thaini,</span>’ etc. are very large.”</p>

<p class='c001'>If the ceorls ever did form an integral part of the legislature in the
kingdom of Kent, the whole question is settled. But I do not contemplate
the thanes in Kent acting here as a legislative body: that is, I do
not believe Æðelstán’s witan in Wessex to have passed a law, and then
his witan in Kent to have accepted or continued it. I believe his witan
from all England to have made certain enactments, which the proper
officers brought down to the various shires, and in the shiremoots there
took pledge of the shire-thanes that they accepted and would abide by
the premises; just as in the case quoted on the preceding page. And
this is the more striking because there is every reason to suppose that
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span> whose acts the shire-thanes of Kent thus accepted
was actually holden at Feversham in that county. But it is further to
be observed that the document we possess is a late Latin translation
of the original sent to Æðelstán: I will venture to assert that in that
original the words used were, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ealle scírþegnas on Cent, ge eorl ge
ceorl,</span>” or perhaps “<span lang="anf" xml:lang="anf">ge twelfhynde ge twihynde.</span>” Again, there is no
reason to suppose that the ceorls did <em>not</em> form an integrant part of the
shiremoot, the representative of the ancient, independent legislature.
A full century later than the date of the council of Feversham, they
continued to do so in the same kingdom or, at that period, earldom:
and it will be readily admitted that during those hundred years the
tendency of society was not to increase the power or improve the condition
of the ceorl. Between 1013 and 1020 we thus find Cnut addressing
the authorities in Kent (Cod. Dipl. No. 731):—“Cnut the
king sends friendly greeting to archbishop Lýfing, bishop Godwine,
abbot Ælfmǽr, Æðelwine the sheriff, Æðelríc, and all my thanes, both
twelve-hundred and two-hundred men,—ealle míne þegnas twelfhynde
and twihynde:”—in other words, both eorl and ceorl, nobilis and ignobilis,
or as the witan of Æðelstán have it, in the Norman translation,
comites et villani. The nature of Cnut’s writ, which is addressed to
the authorities of the county, the archbishop and sheriff, shows clearly
that the thanes in question are not those royal officers called cyninges
þegnas—who could never be two-hundred men—but the scírþegnas.
These are of frequent occurrence in Anglosaxon documents. The scírgemót
at Ægelnóðes stán (about 1038) was attended by Æðelstán the
bishop, Ranig the ealdorman, Bryning the sheriff and all the thanes in
Herefordshire. Cod. Dipl. No. 755. A sale by Stigand was witnessed
by all the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><a id='corr233.2.47'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='scírþegenas'>scírþegnas</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_233.2.47'><ins class='correction' title='scírþegenas'>scírþegnas</ins></a></span></span> in Hampshire; that is, it was a public instrument
completed in the shiremoot. Cod. Dipl. No. 949. Again a grant of
Stigand was witnessed about 1053 by various authorities in Hampshire,
including Eádsige the sheriff and all the scírþegnas. Cod. Dipl. No.
1337: and similarly a third of the same prelate, Cod. Dipl. No. 820.
About the same period Wulfwold abbot of Bath makes title to lands,
which he addresses to bishop Gisa, Tofig the sheriff and all the thanes
of Somersetshire. Cod. Dipl. No. 821. In the year 1049, Ðurstán
granted lands at Wimbush by witness of a great number of persons,
among whom are Leófcild the sheriff and all the thanes of Essex.
Cod. Dipl. No. 788: and about the same time Gódríc bought lands at
Offham, in a shiremoot at Wii, before all the shire. Cod. Dipl. No. 789.
Lastly, Leófwine bought land, by witness of Ulfcytel the sheriff and all
the thanes in Herefordshire. Cod. Dipl. No. 802. The relation of these
thanes to the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gódan</span> men or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">dohtigan</span> men (good men, doughty men,
boni et legales homines, Scabini, Rachinburgii, etc.) will be examined
in a subsequent Book, when I come to treat of the courts of justice: but
I will here add one example, which is illustrative of the subject of this
note. The marriage-covenants of Godwine, arranged before Cnut, by
witness of archbishop Lyfing and others, including Æðelwine the sheriff,
and various Kentish landowners, are stated to be in the knowledge
(geenǽwe) of every <em>doughty man</em> in Kent and Sussex (where the lands
lay) both thane and churl. Cod. Dipl. No. 732. There was nothing
whatever to prevent a man from being a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírþegn</span>, whether eorlcund or
ceorlcund, as long as he had land in the scír itself: without land, even
a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cyninges þegn</span> could certainly not be a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírþegn</span>. It is true that a
man might be of síðcund rank, that is noble, without owning land (see
Leg. Ini, § 51), and there were king’s thanes who had no land (Æðelst.
v. § 11); but such a one could assuredly not represent himself in the scírgemót.
There is a common error which runs through much of what
has been admitted on this subject: the ceorl is universally represented
in a low condition. This is not however necessarily the case: some
ceorls, though well to do in the world, may have preferred their independence
to the conventional dignity of thaneship. We may admit, as
a general rule, that the thanes were a wealthier class than the ceorls;
indeed, without becoming a thane, a ceorl had little chance of getting
a grant of folcland or bócland, but some of them may have, through
various circumstances, inherited or purchased considerable estates: as
late as the year 984, I find an estate of eight hides (that is 264 acres
according to my reckoning) in the possession of a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rusticus</i></span>, obviously a
ceorl:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Illud videlicet rus quod Æðeríc quidam rusticus prius habuisse
agnoscitur.</span>” Cod. Dipl. No. 1282.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f582'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r582'>582</a>. Thorpe, i. 216. Æðelstán complains on another occasion that the
oaths and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>weds</i></span> which had been given <em>to the king and his witan</em> were
all broken: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quia iuramenta et vadia, quae regi et sapientibus data
fuerunt, semper infracta sunt et minus observata quam Deo et saeculo
conveniant.</span>” Æðelst. iii. § 3. Thorpe, i. 218. Again: Æðelstán the
king makes known, that I have learned that our peace is worse kept
than is pleasing to me, or as was ordained at Greatley; and my witan
say that I have borne with it too long.... Because the oaths, and weds,

Wulfhelm, Hroðweard, and other prelates. The boundaries were
solemnly led, and then the assembled bishops and abbots excommunicated

  <h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER VII. <br /> THE TOWNS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>We have now arrived at that point of our enquiry
at which it behoves us to bestow our attention
upon the origin and growth of towns among the
Anglosaxons; and to this end we shall find it
expedient to carry our researches to a still earlier
period, and investigate, though in a slight degree,
the condition of their British and Roman predecessors
in this respect. At first sight it would seem
natural to suppose that where a race had long possessed
the outward means and form of civilization,—a
race among whom great military and civil establishments
had been founded, who had clustered
round provincial cities, the seats of a powerful government,
and whose ports and harbours had been
the scenes of active commerce,—there need be little
question as to the origin of towns and cities among
those who conquered and dispossessed them. It
might be imagined that the later comers would have
nothing more to do than seize upon the seats from
which they had expelled their predecessors, and apply
to their own uses the established instruments
of convenience, of wealth or safety. Further enquiry
however proves that this induction would
be erroneous, and that the Saxons did not settle in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>the Roman towns. The reason of this is not difficult
to assign: a city is the result of a system
of cultivation, and it is of no use whatever to a
race whose system differs entirely from that of the
race by whom it was founded. The Curia and
the temple, the theatre and thermae, house joined
to house and surrounded by a dense quadrangular
wall, crowding into a defined and narrow space the
elements of civilization, are unintelligible to him
whose whole desire centres in the undisturbed enjoyment
of his éðel, and unlimited command of
the mark. The buildings of a centralized society are
as little calculated for his use as their habits and
institutions: as well might it have been proposed
to him to substitute the jurisdiction of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praetor
urbanus</i></span> for the national tribunal of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">folcmót</span>.
The spirit of life is totally different: as different
are all the social institutions, and all the details
which arise from these and tend to confirm and
perpetuate them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless we cannot doubt that the existence
of the British and Roman cities did materially influence
the mode and nature of the German settlements;
and without some slight sketch of the growth
and development of the former, we shall find it
impossible to form a clear notion of the conditions
under which the Anglosaxon polity was formed.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we may implicitly trust the report of Caesar,
a British city in his time differed widely from what
we understand by that term. A spot difficult of
access from the trees which filled it, surrounded
with a rampart and a ditch, and which offered a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>refuge from the sudden incursions of an enemy,
could be dignified by the name of an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>oppidum</i></span>, and
form the metropolis of Cassivelaunus<a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c012'><sup>[754]</sup></a>. Such also
among the Slavonians were the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vici</i></span>, encircled by
an <em><a id='corr204.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>abbatis</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_204.5'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>abbatis</ins></a></span></em> of timber, or at most a paling, proper
to repel not only an unexpected attack, but even
capable of resisting for a time the onset of practised
forces: such in our own time have been found
the stockades of the Burmese, and the Pah of the
New Zealander: and if our skilful engineers have
experienced no contemptible resistance, and the
lives of many brave and disciplined men have been
sacrificed in their reduction, we may admit that
even the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>oppida</i></span> of Cassivelaunus, or Caratac or
Galgacus, might, as fortresses, have serious claims
to the attention of a Roman commander. But
such an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>oppidum</i></span> is no town or city in the sense in
which those words are contemplated throughout
this chapter: by a town I certainly intend a place
enclosed in some manner, and even fortified: but
much more those who dwell together in such a
place, and the means by which they either rule
themselves, or are ruled. I mean a metaphysical
as well as a physical unit,—not exclusively what
was a collection of dwellings or a fortification, but
a centre of trade and manufacture and civilization.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the Romans found none such, at least they left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>them, in every part of Britain. The record of their
gradual and successive advance shows that, partly
with a politic view of securing their conquests,
partly with the necessary aim of conciliating their
soldiery, they did establish numerous <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>municipia</i></span> and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>coloniae</i></span> here, as well as military stations which in
time became the nuclei of towns.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is however scarcely possible that Caesar and
Strabo can be strictly accurate in their reports, or
that there were from the first only such towns in
Britain as these authors have described. It is not
consonant to experience that a thickly peopled and
peaceful country<a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c012'><sup>[755]</sup></a> should long be without cities. A
commercial people<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c012'><sup>[756]</sup></a> always have some settled stations
for the collection and interchange of commodities,
and fixed establishments for the regulation
of trade. Caesar himself tells us that the buildings
of the Britons were very numerous, and that they
bore a resemblance to those of the Gauls<a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c012'><sup>[757]</sup></a>, whose
cities were assuredly considerable. Moreover a
race so conversant with the management of horses
as to use armed chariots for artillery, are not likely
to have been without an extensive system of roads,
and where there are roads, towns will not long
be wanting. Hence when, less than eighty years
after the return of the Romans to Britain, and
scarcely forty after the complete subjugation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>island by Agricola, Ptolemy tells us of at least fifty-six
cities in existence here<a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c012'><sup>[758]</sup></a>, we may reasonably conclude
that they were not all due to the efforts of
Roman civilization.</p>

<p class='c001'>Caesar says indeed nothing of London, yet it
is difficult to believe that this was an unimportant
place, even in his day. It was long the principal
town of the Cantii, whom the Roman general describes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>as the most polished of the inhabitants of
Britain; and as we know that there was an active
commercial intercourse between the eastern coast
of England and Gaul, it is at least probable that a
station, upon a great river at a safe yet easy distance
from the sea, was not unknown to the foreign
merchants who traded to our shores<a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c012'><sup>[759]</sup></a>. One hundred
and sixteen years later it could be described
as a city famous in a high degree for the resort of
merchants and for traffic<a id='r760' /><a href='#f760' class='c012'><sup>[760]</sup></a>: but of these years one
hundred had been spent in peace and in the natural
development of their resources by the Britons, undisturbed
by Roman ambition; and we have therefore
ample right to infer that from the very first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Cair Lunden had been a place of great commercial
importance. The Romans on their return found
and kept it so, although they did not establish a
colonia there. The first place which received this
title with all its corresponding advantages was
Camelodunum, probably the British Cair Colun,
now Colchester in Essex<a id='r761' /><a href='#f761' class='c012'><sup>[761]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the settlement of the nations, and their reduction
under a centralizing system, followed the
victories of the legions, municipia and coloniae
arose in every province, the seats of garrisons and
the residences of military and civil governors:
while as civilization extended, the Britons themselves,
adopting the manners and following the
example of their masters, multiplied the number of
towns upon all the great lines of internal communication.
It is difficult now to give from Roman
authorities only a complete list of these towns;
many names which we find in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>itineraria</i></span> and
similar documents, being merely post-stations or
points where subordinate provincial authorities
were located; but the names of fifty-six towns have
been already quoted from Ptolemy, and even tradition
may be of some service to us on this subject<a id='r762' /><a href='#f762' class='c012'><sup>[762]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Nennius sums up with patriotic pride the names
of thirty-four principal cities which adorned Britain
under his forefathers, and many of these we can
yet identify: amongst them are London, Bristol,
Canterbury, Colchester, Cirencester, Chichester,
Gloucester, Worcester, Wroxeter, York, Silchester,
Lincoln, Leicester, Doncaster, Caermarthen,
Carnarvon, Winchester, Porchester, Grantchester,
Norwich, Carlisle, Chester, Caerleon on Usk, Manchester
and Dorchester<a id='r763' /><a href='#f763' class='c012'><sup>[763]</sup></a>. To these from other sources
we may add Sandwich, Dover, Rochester, Nottingham,
Exeter, Bath, Bedford, Aylesbury and St.
Alban’s.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever the origin of these towns may have
been, it is easy to show that many of them comprised
a Roman population: the very walls by
which some of them are still surrounded, offer conclusive
evidence of this; while in the neighbourhood
of others, coins and inscriptions, the ruins of
theatres, villas, baths, and other public or private
buildings, attest either the skill and luxury of the
conquerors, or the aptness to imitate of the conquered<a id='r764' /><a href='#f764' class='c012'><sup>[764]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>But a much more important question
arises; viz. how many of them were ruled freely,
like the cities of the old country, by a municipal
body constituted in the ancient form: what provision,
in short, the Romans made or permitted for
the education of their British subjects in the manly
career of citizenship and the dignity of self-government<a id='r765' /><a href='#f765' class='c012'><sup>[765]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The constitution of a provincial city of the empire,
in the days when the republic still possessed
virtue and principle, was of this description, at all
events from the period of the Social, Marsic or
Italian war, when the cities of Italy wrested isopolity,
or at least isotely, from Rome. The state consisted
of the whole body of the citizens, without
distinction, having a general voice in the management
of their own internal affairs. The administrative
functions however resided in a privileged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>class of those citizens, commonly called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curiales</i></span>,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Decuriones</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ordo Decurionum</i></span> (or sometimes <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ordo</i></span>
alone), and occasionally <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Senatus</i></span>. They were in
fact to the whole body of the citizens what the
Senatus under the Emperors was to the citizens
of Rome<a id='r766' /><a href='#f766' class='c012'><sup>[766]</sup></a>, and their rights and privileges seem in
general to have varied very much as did those of
the higher body. They were hereditary, but, when
occasion demanded an increase of their numbers,
self-elected. Out of this college of Decuriones the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Magistratus</i></span> or supreme executive government proceeded.
In the better days I believe these were
always freely chosen for one year, by the whole
community, but exclusively from among the members
of the Ordo: and after Tiberius at Rome
transferred the elections from the Comitia to the
Senate, the Decuriones in the provinces may have
become the sole electors, as they were the only
persons capable of being elected. The Magistratus
had the supreme jurisdiction, and were the completion
of the communal system: they bore different
names in different cities, but usually those
of Duumviri or Quatuorviri, from their number.
Sometimes, but very rarely, they were named Consules.
In fact the general outline of this constitution
resembled as much as possible that of Rome
itself, which was only the head of a confederation
embracing all the cities of Italy.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>A somewhat similar arrangement was introduced
into the cities of the various countries which, under
the name of provinces, were brought within the
influence of the Roman power: only that in these
the communal organization was throughout subordinated
to the regulation and control of the Consularis,
the Legatus, Procurator, and other officers
military and fiscal, who administered the affairs of
the province. A principal point of distinction between
the free communities of Italy and the dependent
provincial corporations lay in this: that in
the latter, the magistrates were indeed elected by
the Ordo or Curia, but upon the nomination of the
Roman governor: their jurisdiction in suits was
consequently very limited, while political functions
were for the most part confined to the civil and
military officers of the empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>As long as the condition of the imperial city
itself was tolerably easy, and the provinces had
not yet been flooded with the vice, corruption and
misery which called for and rendered possible the
victories of the barbarians, the condition of the provincial
decurions was on the whole one of honour
and advantage. They formed a kind of nobility, a
class distinguished from their fellow-citizens by a
certain rank and privileges, as they were assuredly
also distinguished from them by superior wealth:
they resembled in fact an aristocracy of county
families at this day, with its exclusive possession
of the magistrature and other local advantages.
On the other hand they were responsible for the
public dues, the levies, the annona or victualling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>of forces, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tributum</i></span> or raising of the assessed
taxes; and thus they were rendered immediately
subject to the exactions of the fiscal authorities,
and especially exposed to the caprice and illegal
demands of the Roman officials<a id='r767' /><a href='#f767' class='c012'><sup>[767]</sup></a>—a class universally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>infamous for tyrannical extortion in the provinces:
and in yet later times, when the land itself
frequently became deserted, through the burthen of
taxation and exaction<a id='r768' /><a href='#f768' class='c012'><sup>[768]</sup></a>, they were compelled to undertake
the cultivation of the relinquished estates,
that the fiscus might be no loser. Gradually as the
bond which held the fragments of the empire together
was loosened, and as limb after limb dropped
away from the mouldering colossus, the condition
of a Decurion became so oppressive that it
was found necessary to press citizens by force into
the office: some committed suicide, others expatriated
themselves, in order to escape it. The state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>was obliged to forbid by law the sale of property
for the purpose of avoiding it; freemen went into
the ranks, or subjected themselves to voluntary
servitude, as a preferable alternative; nay at length
vagabonds, people of bad character, even malefactors,
were literally condemned to it<a id='r769' /><a href='#f769' class='c012'><sup>[769]</sup></a>. This tends
perhaps more than any fact to prove the gradual
ruin of the municipal as well as the social fabric,
and the miserable condition of the provinces under
the later emperors.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, in the better days of Vespasian, Trajan
and the Antonines we are not to look for such
a state of society; and in the provinces, the Ordo,
though exposed to many harsh and painful conditions,
yet held a position of comparative dignity
and influence. I have compared them to a county
aristocracy, but there is perhaps a nearer parallel,
for in the Roman empire it is difficult to distinguish
the county from the town. The position of the
Decurions can hardly be made clearer than by a
reference to the Select (that is self-elected) Vestries
of our great metropolitan parishes before the passing
of Sir John Hobhouse’s Acts; or to the town-councillors
and aldermen of our country-towns,
before the enactment of the Municipal Corporations’
Bill. Whoso remembers these bodies with
their churchwardens on the one hand, their mayors,
borough-reeves and aldermen on the other,—their
exclusive jurisdiction as a magistracy,—their exclusive
possession of corporation property, tolls,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>rents and other sources of wealth,—their private
rights in the common land, held by themselves or
delegated to their <em>clients</em>,—their custody of the
public buildings, and sole management of civic or
charitable funds,—their patronage as trustees of
public institutions,—their franchise as electors,—their
close family alliances, and the methods by
which they contrived to recruit their diminished
numbers, till they became a very aristocracy among
a people of commoners<a id='r770' /><a href='#f770' class='c012'><sup>[770]</sup></a>,—whoso, I say, considers
these phænomena of our own day, need have little
difficulty not only in understanding the condition
of a Decurion in the better days of the Roman
empire: but, if he will cast his thought back into
earlier ages, he may find in them no little illustration
of the nature, rights and policy of the Patriciate,
under the Republic.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other cities of a less favoured description were
governed directly as præfectures, by an officer sent
from Rome, who centred in himself all the higher
branches of administration: in these cities the
functions of the Ordo were greatly curtailed; little
was left them but to attend to the police of the
town and markets, the determination of trifling
civil suits, the survey of roads or buildings; and,
in conjunction with the heads of the guilds (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">collegia
opificum</span>”) the vain and mischievous attempt
to regulate wages and prices. On the other hand
a few cities had what was called the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus Italicum</span>,
or right to form a free corporation, in every respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>identical with those of the cities of Italy, that is to
say identical in plan with that of Rome itself. The
provinces of the Roman empire must have contained
many of these privileged states which thus
enjoyed a valuable pre-eminence over their neighbours,
the reward of public services: but history
has been sparing of their names, and in western
Europe, three only, Cologne, Vienne and Lyons are
particularly mentioned<a id='r771' /><a href='#f771' class='c012'><sup>[771]</sup></a>. In all the cities which
had not this privilege, after the close of the fourth
century we find a particular officer called the Defensor,
who was not to be one of the curiales, who
was to be elected by the whole body of the citizens
and not by the curiales only, and who must therefore
be looked upon in a great degree as the representative
of the popular against the aristocratic
element, as the support of the Cives against the
Senatus and Duumvir. In the cities of Gaul, the
bishops for the most part occupied this position,
which necessarily led to results of the highest importance,
from the peculiar relation in which it
placed them to the barbarian invaders<a id='r772' /><a href='#f772' class='c012'><sup>[772]</sup></a>. From all
these details it appears that very different measures
of municipal freedom were granted under different
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have considered the general principles of
Roman provincial government, and we now ask,
how were these applied in the case of Britain? The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>answer is much more difficult to give than might
be imagined. Wealthy as this country was, and
capable of conducing to the power and well-being
of its masters, it seems never to have received a
generous, or even fair treatment from them. The
Briton was to the last, as at the first, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">penitus toto
divisus orbe Britannus,</span>” and his land, always
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultima Thule,</span>” was made indeed to serve the avarice
or ambition of the ruler, but derived little benefit
to itself from the rule. “Levies, Corn, Tribute,
Mortgages, Slaves”—under these heads was Britain
entered in the vast <em>ledger</em> of the Empire. The
Roman records do not tell us much of the details
of government here, and we may justly say that we
are more familiar with the state of an eastern or
an Iberian city than we are with that of a British
one. A few technical words, perfectly significant
to a people who, above all others, symbolized a
long succession of facts under one legal term, are
all that remain to us; and unfortunately the jurists
and statesmen and historians whose works we painfully
consult in hopes of rescuing the minutest
detail of our early condition, are satisfied with the
use of general terms which were perfectly intelligible
to those for whom they wrote, but teach us
little. “Ostorius Scapula reduced the hither Britain
to the form of a province<a id='r773' /><a href='#f773' class='c012'><sup>[773]</sup></a>,”—conveyed ample
information to those who took the institutions of
the Empire for granted wherever its eagles flew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>abroad: to us they are nearly vain words, a detailed
explanation of which would be valuable beyond
all calculation, for it would contain the secret
of the weakness and the sudden collapse of
the Empire. But what little we can gather from
ancient sources does not induce us to believe that
Britain met with a just or enlightened measure of
treatment at the hands of her victors. Violence
on the one hand, seduction on the other, were employed
to destroy the spirit of resistance, but we
do not learn that submission and docility were rewarded
by the communication of a fair share of
those advantages which spring from peace and cultivation.
Agricola, whose information his severe
and accomplished son-in-law must be considered
to reproduce, tells us that, on the whole, the Britons
were not difficult subjects to rule, as long as
they were not insulted by a capricious display of
power: “The Britons themselves are not backward
in raising the levies and taxes, or filling the offices<a id='r774' /><a href='#f774' class='c012'><sup>[774]</sup></a>,
if they are only not exposed to insult in doing it.
Insult they will not submit to; for we have beaten
them into obedience, but by no means yet into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>slavery.” In this peaceable disposition Agricola
saw the readiest means of producing a complete and
radical subjection to Rome; and on this basis he
formed his plan of rendering resistance powerless.
He entirely relinquished the forcible method of his
predecessors and applied himself to break down the
national spirit by the spreading of foreign arts and
luxuries among the people; judging rightly that
the seductive allurements of ease and cultivation
would ere long prove more efficient and less costly
instruments than the constant and dangerous exercise
of military coercion. “Those who did not
deeply sound the purposes of men, called this civilization;
but it was part and parcel of slavery itself<a id='r775' /><a href='#f775' class='c012'><sup>[775]</sup></a>.”
Temples there were, fora, porticoes, baths and
luxurious feasts, Roman manners and Roman vices,
and to support them loans, usurious mortgages and
ruin. But we seek in vain for any evidence of the
Romanized Britons having been employed in any
offices of trust or dignity, or permitted to share in
the really valuable results of civilization: there is
no one Briton recorded of whom we can confidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>assert that he held any position of dignity and
power under the imperial rule: the historians, the
geographers, nay even the novelists (who so often
supply incidental notices of the utmost interest), are
here consulted in vain; nor in the many inscriptions
which we possess relating to Britain, can we
point out one single British name. The caution of
Augustus and Tiberius had from the first detected
the difficulties which would attend the maintenance
of the Roman authority in Britain: the feeling
at home was, that it would be much more profitable
to raise a small revenue in Gaul upon the
British exports and imports, than to attempt to
draw tribute from the island, which would require
a considerable military force for its collection<a id='r776' /><a href='#f776' class='c012'><sup>[776]</sup></a>.
During their administration therefore the island
was left undisturbed; and even after Claudius had
relinquished this wise moderation, and engaged the
Roman arms in a career of unceasing struggles,
Nero felt anxious to abandon a conquest which promised
little to the state and could only be maintained
by the most exhausting efforts. That this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>reasonable object was defeated in part by the vanity
of the Romans themselves is probable<a id='r777' /><a href='#f777' class='c012'><sup>[777]</sup></a>: but a more
cogent reason is to be found in the interests of the
noble usurers, of which we have seen so striking
an example in the philosophical Seneca. Against
such motives even the moderation and justice of an
Agricola could avail but little: and after his recall
and disgrace by Domitian, it is easy to imagine
that the Roman officials here would not be too
anxious by their good government to attain a dangerous
popularity. Selfish and thoroughly unprincipled
as the Roman government was in all its dependencies,
it is little to be thought that it would
manifest any unusual tenderness in this distant,
unprofitable and little known possession: and I
think we cannot entertain the least doubt that the
condition of the British aborigines was from the
first one of oppression, and was to the very last
a mere downward progress from misery to misery.
But such a system as this—ruinous to the conquered,
and beneficial even to the conquerors only
as long as they could maintain the law of force—had
no inherent vitality. It rested upon a crime,—a
sin which in no time or region has the providence
of the Almighty blessed,—the degradation of one
class on pretext of benefiting another. And as
the sin, so was also the retribution. The Empire
itself might have endured here, had the Romans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>taught the Britons to be men, and reconstituted a
vigorous state upon that basis, in the hour of ruin,
when province after province was torn away from
the city, and the curse of an irresponsible will in
feeble hands was felt through every quarter of the
convulsed and distracted body. But the Britons
had been taught the arts and luxuries of cultivation
that they might be enervated. Disarmed, except
when a jealous policy called for levies to be drafted
into distant armies,—congregated into cities on the
Roman plan, that they might forget the dangerous
freedom of their forests,—attracted to share and
emulate the feasts of the victors, that they might
learn to abhor the hard but noble fare of a squalid
liberty,—supported and encouraged in internal war,
that union might not bring strength, and that the
Roman slave-dealer might not lack the objects of
his detestable traffic,—how should they develop
the manly qualities on which the greatness of a
nation rests? How should they be capable of independent
being, who had only been trained as
instruments for the ambition, or victims to the
avarice, of others? To crown all, their beautiful
daughters might serve to amuse the softer hours
of their lordly masters; but there was to be no
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>connubium</i></span>, and thus a half-caste race inevitably
arose among them, growing up with all the vices
of the victors, all the disqualifications of the vanquished.
Nor under such circumstances can population
follow a healthy course of development,
and a hardy race be produced to recruit the power
and increase the resources of the state. No price
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>is indeed too great to pay for civilization,—the
root of all individual and national power; but
mere cultivation may easily be purchased far too
dearly. It is not worth its cost if it is obtained
only by the sacrifice of all that makes life itself of
value.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such, upon the severest and most impartial examination
of the facts which we possess, seems to
me to have been the condition of the British population
under the Romans. No otherwise can we
even plausibly account for the instantaneous collapse
of the imperial authority: it fell, with one
vast and sudden ruin, the moment the artificial
supports upon which it relied, were removed. Had
Britain not been utterly exhausted by mal-administration,
had there remained men to form a reserve,
and resources to victual an army, the last commander
who received the mandate of recall, would
probably have thrown off his allegiance, and proclaimed
himself a competitor for empire. Many
tried the perilous game; all lost it, because the
country was incapable of furnishing the means to
maintain a contest: and in the meanwhile, the
Saxons proceeded to settle the question in their
own way. As such a state of society supplied no
materials for the support of the Roman power, so
it furnished no elements of self-subsistence when
that power was removed; when that hour at length
arrived, the possibility of which the overweening confidence
in the fortune of the city had never condescended
to contemplate. Before the eyes of all the
nations, and amidst the ruins of a world falling to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>pieces in confusion, was this awful lesson written
in gigantic characters by the hand of God—that
authority which rules ill, which rules for its own
selfish ends alone, is smitten with weakness, and
shall not endure. It was then that a long-delayed,
but not the less awful retribution burst at last upon
the enfeebled empire. Goth and Vandal, Frank and
Sueve and Saxon lacerated its defenceless frontiers;
the terrible Attila—the Scourge of God—ravaged
with impunity its fairest provinces; the eternal
city itself twice owed its safety to the superstition
or the contemptuous mercy of the barbarians whose
forefathers had trembled at its name even in the
depths of their forest fastnesses; the legions, unable
to maintain themselves, and called—but called
in vain—to defend a state perishing by its own
corruptions, left Britain exposed to the attack of
fierce and barbarous enemies that thronged on every
side. Without arms and discipline, and what is
far more valuable than these, the spirit of self-reliance
and faith in the national existence, the Britons
perished as they stood: bowing to the inevitable
fate, they passed only from one class
of task-masters to another, and slowly mingled
with the masses of the new conquerors, or fell
in ill-conducted and hopeless resistance to their
progress.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Keltic laws and monuments themselves supply
conclusive evidence of the justice of these
general observations. Throughout all the ages
during which these populations were in immediate
contact with Rome, not a single ray of Keltic nationality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>is able to penetrate. It is only among the
mountains of the Cymri, a savage race, as little
subjugated by the Romans, as even to this moment
by ourselves, that a trace of that nationality is to
be found. There indeed, guarded by fortresses
which nature itself made impregnable, the heartblood
of Keltic society was allowed to beat; and
the barbarians whom policy affected or luxury could
afford to despise, grew up in an independence, features
of which we can still recognize in their legal
and poetical remains. The pride of the invaders
might be soothed by the erection of a few castra, or
praesidia or castella in the Welsh marches; the itinerary
of an emperor might finish in a commercial
city on the Atlantic; but in Wales the Romans had
hardly a foot of ground which they did not overshadow
with the lines of their fortresses; and to
the least instructed eye, the chain of fortified
posts which guard every foot of ground to the east
of the Severn tells of a contemplated retreat and
defence upon the base of that strong line of entrenchments.</p>

<p class='c001'>And yet how insufficient are the laws and triads
of the Cymri in point of mere antiquity! Let us
do all honour to the praiseworthy burst of Keltic
patriotism which has revived in our day: let us
even concede that some few of the triads may carry
us back to the sixth century: yet the earliest
Cymric laws of which the slightest trace can be
discovered, are those of Hywel in the tenth. And
even, if with a courteous desire to do justice to
the subject, we admit the historical existence of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>fabulous Dynwall and fabulous Marcia<a id='r778' /><a href='#f778' class='c012'><sup>[778]</sup></a>, who has
even insinuated that a single sentence of their
codes survive; or that, if even if such existed, they
had currency a single foot to the eastward of the
Severn? Who can imagine that such laws ever
had authority beyond the boundaries of a solitary
sept, more fortunate than the rest, inasmuch as
its record has not, like those of others, perished?</p>

<p class='c001'>More directly to the purpose is the information
we derive from Gildas, whose patriotism is beyond
suspicion, and whose antiquity gives his assertions
some claim to our respect<a id='r779' /><a href='#f779' class='c012'><sup>[779]</sup></a>. He tells us that on
the final departure of the Romans, including the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>armatus miles</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>militaires copiae</i></span>, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rectores immanes</i></span>
(by which last words he may possibly intend the
civil officers called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rectores provinciarum</i></span>), Britain
was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>omnis belli usu penitus ignara</i></span>, utterly ignorant
of the practice of war<a id='r780' /><a href='#f780' class='c012'><sup>[780]</sup></a>: the island was consequently
soon overrun by predatory bands of Picts and
Scots whose ravages reduced the inhabitants to the
extremest degree of misery: and these incursions
were followed at no great interval of time by so
violent a pestilence that the living were hardly
numerous enough to bury the dead<a id='r781' /><a href='#f781' class='c012'><sup>[781]</sup></a>. Then having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>briefly noticed the savage invasion of the Saxons,
and a defeat which he says they sustained at Bath,
and which is supposed to have been given them by
Arthur in the year 520, he thus continues: “But
not even now, as before, are the cities of my
country inhabited; deserted and destroyed, they
lie neglected even unto this day: for civil wars continue,
though foreign wars have ceased<a id='r782' /><a href='#f782' class='c012'><sup>[782]</sup></a>.” We can
easily imagine that a nation in anything like the
state which Gildas describes, might suffer severely
from the brigandage of banditti in the interior;
and on the frontier, from raids and forays of the
Picts and Scots. Attacks which even the disciplined
soldiery of Rome found it necessary to bridle by
means of such structures as the walls of Hadrian,
Antonine and Severus, must have had terror enough
for a disarmed and disheartened population; nor
is it in the least degree improbable that the universal
disorder, the withdrawal of the legions and some
new immigration of Teutonic adventurers set in
motion populations, which in various parts of the
country had hitherto rested quietly under the nominal
control of the Roman arms. But still it is
not without surprise that we notice the absence
of all evidence that the Britons even attempted to
maintain the cities the Romans had left them, or
to make a vigorous defence behind their solid fortifications,
inexpugnable one would think by rude
undisciplined assailants. It is true, we are told that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>in half a century England had gone entirely out of
cultivation, and that the land had again become
covered with forests which alone supplied food for
the inhabitants<a id='r783' /><a href='#f783' class='c012'><sup>[783]</sup></a>: but if this were really the case—and
it is not entirely improbable—it can only
have had the effect of driving the population into
the cities. That these were to a great extent still
standing in the fifth century is certain, since Gildas,
in the sixth, represents them as deserted and
decaying; that the Saxons found them yet entire
is obvious; in the tenth and twelfth centuries their
ancient grandeur attracted the attention of observant
historians<a id='r784' /><a href='#f784' class='c012'><sup>[784]</sup></a>; and even yet their remains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>testify to the astonishing skill and foresight of
their builders. I cannot therefore but believe that
Britain really was, as described, disarmed and disheartened,
and most probably so depopulated as to
be incapable of any serious defence: a condition
which throws a hideous light upon the nature of
the Roman rule and the practices of Roman civilized
life.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is highly improbable that any large number
of the Roman towns perished during the harassing
period within which the Pictish invasions fall, at all
events by violent means. The marauding forays of
such barbarians are not accompanied with battering
trains or supported by the skilful combinations of
an experienced commissariat: wandering banditti
have neither the means to destroy such masonry as
the Romans erected, the time to execute, nor in
general the motive to form such plans of subversion.
One or two cities may possibly have fallen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>under the furious storm of the Saxons, and Anderida
is recorded to have done so: more than this
seems to me unlikely: Keltic populations have generally
been found capable of making a very good
defence behind walls, in spite of the ridiculous
accounts which Gildas gives of their ineffectual resistance
to the Picts<a id='r785' /><a href='#f785' class='c012'><sup>[785]</sup></a>. The Roman cities perished,
it is true, but by a far slower and surer process
than that of violent disruption; they crumbled
away under the hand of time, the ruinous consequences
of neglect, and the operation of natural
causes, which science finds no difficulty in assigning.
We may believe that the gradual impoverishment
of the land had driven the population to
crowd into cities, even before the retreat of the
legions; and that the troublous era of the tyrants<a id='r786' /><a href='#f786' class='c012'><sup>[786]</sup></a>
completely emptied the country into the towns.
But even if we suppose that citizens remained and,
what is rather an extravagant supposition, that
they remained undisturbed in their old seats, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>shall find that there are obvious reasons why they
could not maintain themselves therein. There are
conditions necessary to the very existence of towns,
and without which it is impossible that they should
continue to endure. They must have town-lands,
and they must have manufactures and trade: in
other words they must either grow bread or buy it:
but to this end they must have the means of safe
and ready communication with country districts,
or with other towns which have this. It matters
not whether that communication be by the sea, as
in the case of Tyre and Carthage<a id='r787' /><a href='#f787' class='c012'><sup>[787]</sup></a>; over the desert,
as at Bagdad and Aleppo; down the river or canal,
along the turnpike road, or yet more compendious
railway: easy and safe communication is the condition
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sine qua non</i></span>, of urban existence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us apply these principles to the case before
us. Even supposing that Gildas and other authors
have greatly exaggerated the state of rudeness into
which the country had fallen, yet we may be certain
that one of the very first results of a general
panic would be the obstruction of the ancient roads
and established modes of communication. It is
certain that this would be followed at first by a
considerable desertion of the towns; since every
one would anxiously strive to secure that by which
he could feed himself and his family; in preference
to continuing in a place which no longer offered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>any advantages beyond those of temporary defence
and shelter. The retirement of the Romans, emigration
of wealthy aborigines, general discomfort
and disorganization of the social condition, and
ever imminent terror of invasion, must soon have
put a stop to those commercial and manufacturing
pursuits which are the foundation of towns and
livelihood of townspeople. Internal wars and merciless
factions which ever haunt the closing evening
of states, increased the misery of their condition;
and a frightful pestilence, by Gildas attributed to
the superfluity of luxuries, but which may far more
probably be accounted for by the want of food,
completed the universal ruin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still even those who fled for refuge to the land,
could find little opportunity of improving their
situation: there was no room for them in an island
which was thenceforward to be organized upon
the Teutonic principles of association. The Saxons
were an agricultural and pastoral people: they required
land for their alods,—forests, marshes and
commons for their cattle: they were not only dangerous
rivals for the possession of those estates
which, lying near the cities, were probably in the
highest state of cultivation, but they had cut off
all communication by extending themselves over
the tracts which lay between city and city. But
they required serfs also, and these might now be
obtained in the greatest abundance and with the
greatest security, cooped up within walls, and caught
as it were in traps, where the only alternative was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>slavery or starvation<a id='r788' /><a href='#f788' class='c012'><sup>[788]</sup></a>. Nor can we reasonably imagine
that such spoils as could yet be wrested from
the degenerate inhabitants were despised by conquerors
whose principle it was that wealth was to
be won at the spear’s point<a id='r789' /><a href='#f789' class='c012'><sup>[789]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt the final triumph of the Saxons was
not obtained entirely without a struggle: here and
there attempts at resistance were made, but never
with such success as to place any considerable obstacle
in the way of the invaders. Spirit-broken,
and reduced both in number and condition, the
islanders gradually yielded to the tempest; and
with some allowance for the rhetorical exaggeration
of the historian, Britain did present a picture such
as Beda and Gildas have left. Stronghold after
stronghold fell, less no doubt by storm (which the
Saxons were in general not prepared to effect) than
by blockade, or in consequence of victories in the
open field. The sack of Anderida by Aelli, and
the extermination of its inhabitants, is the only recorded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>instance of a fortified city falling by violent
breach, and in this case so complete was the destruction
that the ingenuity of modern enquirers
has been severely taxed to assign the ancient site.
But when we are told<a id='r790' /><a href='#f790' class='c012'><sup>[790]</sup></a> that Cúðwulf, by defeating
the Britons in 571 at Bedford, gained possession of
Leighton Buzzard, Aylesbury, Bensington and Ensham,
I understand it only of a wide tract of land in
Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire,
which had previously been dependent upon towns
in those several districts<a id='r791' /><a href='#f791' class='c012'><sup>[791]</sup></a>, and which perished in
consequence. Again when we are told<a id='r792' /><a href='#f792' class='c012'><sup>[792]</sup></a> that six
years later Cúðwine took Bath, and Cirencester
and Gloucester, the statement seems to me only to
imply that he cleared the land from the confines of
Oxfordshire to the Severn and southward to the
Avon, and so rendered it safely habitable by his
Teutonic comrades and allies. Thirty years later
we find Northumbria stretching westward till the
fall of Cair Legion became necessary: accordingly
Æðelfrið took possession of Chester. Its present
condition is evidence enough that he did not level
it with the ground, or in any great degree injure
its <a id='corr295.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='fortications'>fortifications</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_295.24'><ins class='correction' title='fortications'>fortifications</ins></a></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact has been already noticed that the Saxons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>did not themselves adopt the Roman cities, and
the reason for the course they pursued has been
given. They did not want them, and would have
been greatly at a loss to know what to do with
them. The inhabitants they enslaved, or expelled
as a mere necessary precaution and preliminary to
their own peaceable occupation of the land: but
they neither took possession of the towns, nor did
they give themselves the trouble to destroy them<a id='r793' /><a href='#f793' class='c012'><sup>[793]</sup></a>.
They had not the motive, the means or perhaps the
patience to unbuild what we know to have been so
solidly constructed. Where it suited their purpose
to save the old Roman work, they used it for their
own advantage: where it did not suit their views
of convenience or policy to establish themselves on
or near the old sites, they quietly left them to decay.
There is not even a probability that they in general
took the trouble to dismantle walls or houses to
assist in the construction of their own rude dwellings<a id='r794' /><a href='#f794' class='c012'><sup>[794]</sup></a>.
Boards and rafters, much more easily accessible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>and to them much more serviceable, much
more easy of transport than stones and bond-tiles,
they very likely removed: the storms, the dews,
the sunshine, the unperceived and gentle action of
the elements did the rest,—for desolation marches
with giant strides, and neglect is a more potent leveller
than military engines. Clogged watercourses
undermined the strong foundations; decomposed
stucco or the detritus of stone and brick mingled
in the deserted chambers with drifted silt, and dust
and leaves; accumulations of soil formed in and
around the crumbling abodes of wealth and power;
winged seeds, borne on the autumnal winds, sunk
gently on a new and vigorous bed; vegetation
yearly thickening, yearly dying, prepared the genial
deposit; roots yearly matting deepened the crust;
the very sites of cities vanished from the memory
as they had vanished from the eye; till at length
the plough went and the corn waved, as it now
waves, over the remains of palaces and temples in
which the once proud masters of the world had revelled
and had worshipped. Who shall say in how
many unsuspected quarters yet, the peasant whistles
careless and unchidden above the pomp and luxury
of imperial Rome!</p>

<p class='c001'>Many circumstances combined to make a distinction
between the cities of Britain and those of the
Gallic continent. The latter had always been in
nearer relation than our own to Rome: they had
been at all periods permitted to enjoy a much
greater measure of municipal freedom, and were
enriched by a more extensive commercial intercourse.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>England had no city to boast of so free as
Lugdunum, none so wealthy as Massilia. Even in
the time of the Gallic independence they had been
far more advanced in cultivation than the cities of
the Britons, and in later days their organization
was maintained by the residence of Roman bishops
and a wealthy body of clergy. Nor on the other
hand do the Franks appear to have been very
numerous in proportion to the land, a sufficient
amount of which they could appropriate without
very seriously confining the urban populations:
many of these still retained their communications
with the sea: and, lastly, before the conquerors,
slowly advancing from Belgium through Flanders,
had spread themselves throughout the populous
and wealthy parts of Gaul, their chiefs had shown
a readiness to listen to the exhortation of Christian
teachers, to enter into the communion of the
Church, and recognize its rights and laudable customs.
So that in general, whether among the
Lombards in Italy, the Goths in Aquitaine, or the
Franks in Neustria, there was but little reason for
a violent subversion, or even gradual ruin, of the
ancient cities. In these the old subsisting elements
of civilization were still tolerated, and continued to
prevail by the force of uninterrupted usage. More
happy than the demoralized and dispossessed inhabitants
of Britain, the Roman provincials under
the Frankish and Langobardic rule were still numerous
and important enough to retain their own
laws, and the most of their own customs. Skilful
in the character of counsellors or administrators,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>wealthy and enterprising as merchant-adventurers,
dignified and influential as forming almost exclusively
the class of the clergy, they still retained
their old seats, under the protection of the conquerors:
and thus, for the most part their cities
survived the conquest, and continued under their
ancient character, till they slowly gave way at
length in the numerous civil or baronial wars of
the middle ages, and the frequent insurrections of
the urban populations in their struggle for communal
liberties.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is natural to imagine that when once the Saxons
broke up from their peaceful settlements and
commenced a career of aggression, they would direct
their marches by the great lines of roads which
the Roman or British authorities had maintained
in every part of the island. They would thus unavoidably
be brought into the neighbourhood of
earlier towns, and be compelled to decide the question
whether they would attack and occupy them,
or whether they would turn them and proceed on
their march. If the views already expressed in this
chapter be correct, it is plain that no very efficient
resistance was to be feared by the invaders: they
could afford to neglect what in the hands of a population
not degraded by the grossest misgovernment
would have offered an insuperable obstacle. But
the locality of a town is rarely the result of accident
alone: there are generally some conveniences
of position, some circumstances affecting the security,
the comfort or the interests of a people, that
determine the sites of their seats: and these which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>must have been nearly the same for each successive
race, may have determined the Saxons to remain
where they had determined the Britons or
Romans first to settle. Yet even in this case, and
admitting Saxon towns to have gradually grown up
in the neighbourhood of ancient sites, there is no
reason to suppose that either the kings or bishops
made their ordinary residences in them; and thus
in England, a very active element was wanting to
the growth and importance of the towns, which we
find in full force in other Roman provinces. In
truth both king and bishop adopted for the most
part the old Teutonic habit of wandering from vill
to vill, from manor to manor, and in this country
the positions of cathedrals were as little confined
to principal cities as were the positions of palaces.
This is not entirely without strangeness, especially
in the case of the earliest bishops, seeing that we
might reasonably expect Roman missionaries to
choose by preference buildings ready for their purpose,
and of a nature to which they had been accustomed
in Italy. Gregory had himself recommended
that the heathen temples should if possible
be hallowed to Christian uses; and even if Christian
temples were entirely wanting, which we can
scarcely imagine to have been the case<a id='r795' /><a href='#f795' class='c012'><sup>[795]</sup></a>, there were
yet basilicas in Britain, even as there had been in
Rome, which might be made to serve the purposes
of churches. Nevertheless, whatever we do read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>teaches us that in general, on the conversion of a
people, structures of the rudest character were
erected even upon the sites of ancient civilization:
thus in York, Eádwine caused a church of wood to
be built in haste, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">citato opere</span>,” for the ceremony
of his own baptism: thus too in London, upon the
establishment of the see, a new church was built—surely
a proof that Saxon London and Roman
London could not be the same place. It is indeed
probable that the missionaries, yet somewhat uncertain
of success, and not secure of the popular
good-will, desired to fix their residences near those
of the kings, for the sake both of protection and
of influence; and thus, as the kings did not make
their settled residence in cities whether of Saxon or
Roman construction, the sees also were not established
therein<a id='r796' /><a href='#f796' class='c012'><sup>[796]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The town of the Saxons had however a totally
independent origin, and one susceptible of an easy
explanation. The fortress required by a simple
agricultural people is not a massive pile with towers
and curtains, devised to resist the attacks of reckless
soldiers, the assault of battering-trains, the sap
of skilful engineers, or the slow reduction of famine.
A gentle hill crowned with a slight earthwork,
or even a stout hedge, and capacious enough to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>receive all who require protection, suffices to repress
the sudden incursions of marauding enemies, unfurnished
with materials for a siege or provisions to
carry on a blockade<a id='r797' /><a href='#f797' class='c012'><sup>[797]</sup></a>. Here and there such may
have been found within the villages or on the border
of the Mark, tenanted perhaps by an earl or
noble with his comites, and thus uniting the characters
of the mansion and the fortress: around
such a dwelling were congregated the numerous
poor and unfree settlers, who obtained a scanty and
precarious living on the chieftain’s land; as well
as the idlers whom his luxury, his ambition or his
ostentation attracted to his vicinity. Here too may
have been found the rude manufacturers whose
craft supplied the wants of the castellan and his
comrades; who may gradually and by slow experience
have discovered that the outlying owners
also could sometimes offer a market for their productions;
and who, as matter of favour, could obtain
permission from the lord to exercise their skill
on behalf of his neighbours. Similarly round the
church or the cathedral must bodies of men have
gathered, glad to claim its protection, share its
charities and aid in ministering to its wants<a id='r798' /><a href='#f798' class='c012'><sup>[798]</sup></a>. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>hold it undeniable that these people could not feed
themselves, and equally so that food would find its
way to them; that the neighbouring farmer,—instead
of confining his cultivation to the mere
amount necessary for the support of his household
or the discharge of the royal dues,—would on their
account produce and accumulate a capital, through
which he could obtain from them articles of convenience
and enjoyment which he had neither the
leisure nor the skill to make. In this way we may
trace the growth of barter, and that most important
habit of resorting to fixed spots for commercial
and social purposes. In this process the lord had
himself a direct and paramount interest. If he
took upon himself to maintain freedom of buying
and selling, to guarantee peace and security to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>chapmen, going and coming, he could claim in return
a slight recognition of his services in the shape
of toll or custom. If the intervention of his officers
supplied an easy mode of attesting the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bona fides</i></span> of
a transaction, the parties to it would have been
unreasonable had they resisted the jurisdiction
which thus gradually grew up. So that on all accounts
we may be assured that the lord encouraged
as much as possible the resort of strangers to his
domain. In the growing prosperity of his dependents,
his own condition was immediately and extensively
concerned. Even their number was of
importance to his revenue, for a capitation-tax,
however light, was the inevitable condition of
their reception. Their industry as manufacturers
or merchants attracted traffic to his channels.
Lastly in a military, political and social view, the
wealth, the density and the cultivation of his
burgher-population were the most active elements
of his own power, consideration and influence.
What but these rendered the Counts of Flanders
so powerful as they were throughout the middle
ages? Let it now be only considered with what
rapidity all these several circumstances must tend
to combine and to develop themselves, as the class
of free landowners diminishes in extent and influence
and that of the lords increases. Concurrent
with such a change must necessarily be the extension
of mutual dependence, which is only another
name for traffic, and, as far as this alone is
concerned, a great advance in the material well-being
of society. It is difficult to conceive a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>more hopeless state than one in which every household
should exactly suffice to its own wants, and
have no wants but such as itself could supply.
Fortunately for human progress, it is one which
all experience proves to be impossible. There is
no principle of social ethics more certain than
this, that in proportion as you secure to a man the
command of the necessaries of life, you awaken in
him the desire for those things which adorn and
refine it. And all experience also teaches that the
attempt of any individual to provide both classes
of things for himself and within the limits of his
own household, will totally fail; that time is wanting
to produce any one thing in perfection; that
skill can only be attained by exclusive attention to
one object; and that a division of labour is indispensable
if society is to be enabled to secure, at the
least possible sacrifice, the greatest possible amount
of comforts and conveniences. The farmer therefore
raises, stores and sells the abundance of the
grain which he well knows how to gain from his
fields; and, relinquishing the vain attempt to make
clothes or hardware, ornamental furniture and
articles of household utility or elegance, nay even
ploughs and harrows,—the instruments of his industry,—purchases
them with his superfluity. And
so in turn with his superfluity does the mechanic
provide himself with bread which he lacks the land,
the tools and the skill to raise. But the cultivator
and the herdsman require land and space: the
mechanic is most advantageously situated where
numbers concentrate, where his various materials
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>can be brought together cheaply and speedily; where
there is intercourse to sharpen the mind; where
there is population to assist in processes which transcend
the skill or strength of the individual man.
The wealth of the cultivator, that is, his superabundant
bread, awakens the mechanic into existence;
and the existence of the mechanic, speedily leading
to the enterprise of the manufacturer, and the venture
of the distributor, broker, merchant, or shopman,
ultimately completes the growth of the town.
It is unavoidable that the first mechanics—beyond
the heroical weapon-smith on the one hand, and on
the other the poor professors of such rude arts as
the homestead cannot do without,—the wife that
spins, the husbandman that hammers his own share
and coulter—should be those who have no land;
that is, in the state of society which we are now
considering,—the unfree. It is a mere accident
that they should gather round this lord or that, on
his extensive possessions, or that they should seek
shelter, food and protection in the neighbourhood
of the castle or the cathedral: but where they do
settle, in process of time the town must come.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conditions under which this shall constitute
itself are many and various. For a long while they
will greatly depend upon the original circumstances
which accompanied and regulated the settlement.
When a great manufacturing and commercial
system has been founded, embracing states and not
petty localities only, it is clear that petty local interests
will cease to be the guiding principles: but
this state of things transcends the limits of a rude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>and early society. The liberties of the first cities
must often have been mere favours on the part of
the lords who owned the soil, and protected the
dwellers upon it. Later these liberties were the
result of bargains between separate powers, grown
capable of measuring one another. Lastly, they
are necessities imposed by an advanced condition
of human associations, in which the wishes, objects
and desires of the individual man are hurried resistlessly
away by a great movement of civilization,
in which the vast attraction of the mass neutralizes
and defeats all minor forces. It would indeed
be but slight philosophy to suppose that any one
set of circumstances could account for the infinite
variety which the history of towns presents: though
there are features of resemblance common to them
all, yet each has its peculiar story, its peculiar conditions
of progress and decay; even as the children
of one family, which bear a near likeness to each
other, yet each has its own tale of joy and sorrow,
of smiles and tears, of triumph and failure. Yet
there is probably no single element of urban prosperity
more potent than situation, or which more
pervasively modifies all other and concurrent conditions
of success. Let the most careless observer
only compare London, Liverpool and Bristol, I will
not say with Munich or Madrid, but even with
Warwick, Stafford or Winchester. If royal favour
and court gaieties could have made cities great, the
latter should have flourished; for they were the
residences of the rulers of Mercia and Wessex,
the scenes of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemóts</span>, of Christmas festivals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>and Easters when the king solemnly wore his
crown; while the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>ceorls</i></span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>mangeras</i></span> of Brigstow and
Lundenwíc were only cheapening hides with the
Esterlings, warehousing the foreign wines which
were to supply the royal table, or bargaining with
the adventurer from the East for the incense which
was to accompany the high mass in the Cathedral.
But Commerce, the child of opportunity, brought
wealth; wealth, power; and power led independence
in its train.</p>

<p class='c001'>Against the manifold relations which arose during
the gradual development of urban populations,
the original position of the lord could not be maintained
intact. It is indeed improbable that in any
very great number of cases, the inhabitants of an
English town long continued in the condition of
personal serfage. The lords were too weak, the
people too strong, for a system like that of the
French nobles and their towns ever to have become
settled here; nor had our city populations,
like the Gallic provincials, the habit and use of
slavery. The first settlers on a noble’s land may
have been unfree; serfs and oppressed labourers
from other estates may have been glad to take
refuge among them from taskmasters more than ordinarily
severe; but in this unmixed state they did
not long remain. There is no doubt that freemen
gradually united with them under the lord’s protection
or in his alliance; that strangers sojourned
among them in hope of profits from traffic; and
hence that a race gradually grew up, in whom the
original feelings of the several classes survived in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>greatly modified form. To this, though generally
so difficult to trace step by step in history, we owe
the difference of the urban government in different
cities,—distinctions in detail more frequent than
is commonly supposed, and which can be unhesitatingly
referred to the earliest period of urban
existence, if not in fact, at least in principle,—institutions
representing in a shadowy manner the
distant conditions under which they arose, and for
the most part separated in the sharpest contrast
from the ordinary forms prevalent upon the land.</p>

<p class='c001'>The general outline of an urban constitution, in
the earlier days of the Saxons, may have been
somewhat of the following character. The freemen,
either with or without the co-operation of
the lord, but usually with it, formed themselves
into associations or clubs, called <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gylds</i></span>. These must
not be confounded either on the one side with the
Hanses (in Anglosaxon <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Hósa</span>), i. e. trading guilds,
or on the other with the guilds of crafts (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">collegia
opificum</span>”) of later ages. Looking to the analogy
of the country-gylds or Tithings, described in detail
in the ninth chapter of the First Book, we may
believe that the whole free town population was
distributed into such associations; but that in each
town, taken altogether, they formed a compact and
substantive body called in general the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Burhwaru</i></span>,
and perhaps sometimes more especially the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Ingang
burhware</i></span>, or “burgher’s club<a id='r799' /><a href='#f799' class='c012'><sup>[799]</sup></a>.” It is also certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>from various expressions in the boundaries of charters,
as “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Burhware mǽd</span>,” “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burhware mearc</span>,” and
the like, that they were in possession of real property
as a corporate body, whether they had any
provision for the management of corporation revenues,
we cannot tell; but we may unhesitatingly
affirm that the gylds had each its common purse,
maintained at least in part by private contributions,
or what we may more <a id='corr310.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='familarly'>familiarly</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_310.9'><ins class='correction' title='familarly'>familiarly</ins></a></span> term <em>rates</em>
levied under their bye-laws. These gylds, whether
in their original nature religious, political, or
merely social unions, rested upon another and
solemn principle: they were sworn brotherhoods
between man and man, established and fortified
upon “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">áð and wed</span>,” oath and pledge; and in them
we consequently recognize the germ of those sworn
communes, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>communae</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>communiae</i></span><a id='r800' /><a href='#f800' class='c012'><sup>[800]</sup></a>, which in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>times of the densest seigneurial darkness offered a
noble resistance to episcopal and baronial tyranny,
and formed the nursing-cradles of popular liberty.
They were alliances offensive and defensive among
the free citizens, and in the strict theory possessed
all the royalties, privileges and rights of independent
government and internal jurisdiction. How
far they could make these valid, depended entirely
upon the relative strength of the neighbouring lord,
whether he were ealdorman, king or bishop. Where
they had full power, they probably placed themselves
under a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> of their own, duly elected
from among the members of their own body, who
thenceforth took the name of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Portgeréfa</span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Burhgeréfa</span>,
and not only administered justice in the
burhwaremót or husting, on behalf of the whole
state, but if necessary led the city trainbands to
the field. Such a civic political constitution seems
the germ of those later liberties which we understand
by the expression that a city is a county of
itself,—words once more weighty than they now
are, when privilege has become less valuable before
the face of an equal law. Nevertheless there was
once a time when it was no slight advantage for a
population to be under a portreeve or sheriff of
their own, and not to be exposed to the arbitrary
will of a noble or bishop who might claim to exercise
the comitial authority within their precincts.
Such a free organization was capable of placing a
city upon terms of equality with other constituted
powers; and hence we can easily understand the
position so frequently assumed by the inhabitants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>of London. As late as the tenth century, and
under Æðelstán, a prince who had carried the influence
of the crown to an extent unexampled in
any of his predecessors, we find the burghers treating
as power to power with the king, under their
portreeves and bishop: engaging indeed to follow
his advice, if he have any to give which shall be
for their advantage; but nevertheless constituting
their own sworn gyldships or commune, by their
own authority, on a basis of mutual alliance and
guarantee, as to themselves seemed good<a id='r801' /><a href='#f801' class='c012'><sup>[801]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rights of such a corporation were in truth
royal. They had their own alliances and feuds;
their own jurisdiction, courts of justice and power
of execution; their own markets and tolls; their own
power of internal taxation; their personal freedom
with all its dignity and privileges. And to secure
these great blessings they had their own towers
and walls and fortified houses, bell and banner,
watch and ward, and their own armed militia.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such too were the rights which, in more than one
European country, the brave and now forgotten
burghers of the twelfth century strove to wring
from the territorial aristocracy that hemmed them
in; when ancient tradition had not lost its vigour,
though liberty had been trampled under the armed
hoof of power. If we admire and glory in these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>true fathers of popular freedom, firm in success,
unbroken by defeat,—steadfast in council, steadfast
in the field, steadfast even under the seigneurial
gibbet and in the seigneurial dungeon,—let us yet
give our meed of thanks to those still older assertors
of the dignity of man, duly honouring the gyldsmen
of the tenth century, who handed down their
noble inheritance to the less fortunate burgesses of
the twelfth. Few pictures from the past may the
eye rest upon with greater pleasure than that of
a Saxon portreeve looking down from his strong
gyld-hall upon the well-watched walls and gates
that guard the populous market of his city<a id='r802' /><a href='#f802' class='c012'><sup>[802]</sup></a>. The
fortified castle of a warlike lord may frown upon
the adjacent hill; the machicolated and crenelated
walls of the cathedral close, with buttress and drawbridge,
may tell of the temporal power and turbulence
of the episcopate; but in the centre of the
square stands the symbolic statue which marks the
freedom of jurisdiction and of commerce<a id='r803' /><a href='#f803' class='c012'><sup>[803]</sup></a>; balance
in hand, to show the right of unimpeded traffic;
sword in hand, to intimate the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ius gladii</i></span>, the right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>to judge and punish, the right to guard with the
weapons of men all that men hold dearest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, no brighter picture than the present;
when, drawing a veil over the miserable convulsions
of a nearly millennial struggle, we can contemplate
the mayor of the same town wandering
with a satisfied eye over the space where those old
walls once stood, but which now is covered with the
workshop, the manufactory or the house, the reward
of patient, peaceful industry. Looking to the hill,
crowned with its picturesque ruin, he sees the mansion
of a noble citizen united with himself in zealous
obedience to an equal law,—the peer who in
the higher, or the burgess who in the lower house
of parliament, consults for the weal of the community,
and derives his own value and importance
most from the trust reposed in him by his fellow-townsmen.
We can now contemplate this peaceful
magistrate (elected because his neighbours honour
his worth and the character won in a successful
civic career,—not because he is a stout man-at-arms,
or tried in perilous adventure,) when turning
again to the ruined defences of the old cathedral,
he sees streets instinct with life, where the ditch
yawned of yore, walls picturesque with the ivy of
uncounted ages, now carved out into quaint, prebendal
houses; and while he admires the beauty
of their architecture, wonders why the gates of
cathedral closes should have been so strongly built,
or bear so unnecessary a resemblance to fortresses.
Still in the market-place stands the belfry, once
dreaded by the neighbouring tyrant: but its bell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>calls no longer to the defence of a city, which now
fears no enemy. The tenant of its dungeon is no
more a turbulent man-at-arms, or well-born hostage:
the dignity of the prisoner rises no higher
than that of a petty market-pilferer, and the name
of the belfry itself is forgotten in that of the
“cage.” Over the flesh- or fish-stalls perhaps yet
stands the mysterious statue, inherited from earlier
times, but without the meaning of the inheritance.
The sword and balance are still there, but it is no
longer Marsyas or Silenus or Orlando: flowing
robes and bandaged eyes have transformed it into a
harmless allegory; and where the warlike citizen,
whose privileges were maintained with sweat and
blood, erewhile looked upon it as the symbol—if
not the talisman—of freedom, his modern successor,
as his humour leads him, wonders whether <em>Justice</em>
were ever wanting in that place, or smiles to think
that her eyes are closed to the petty tricks of temporary
stall-keepers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Beyond all price indeed is this privilege of quiet
inherited from our earnest forefathers, and great
the debt of gratitude we owe to those whose wisdom
laid, whose courage and patience maintained,
its deep foundations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet not in all cases can we draw so favourable a
picture of the condition of an Anglosaxon town: in
many of them, the unfree dwelt by the side of the
freemen in their gylds, under the presidency of
their lord’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>. And where the number of the
unfree was greatly preponderant, and the power
of the lord proportionally increased, we cannot but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>believe that the freemen themselves were too often
deprived of their most cherished privileges. Without
going quite so far as the custom in some mediæval
towns, where the air itself was emphatically
said to be loaded with serfage,—where slavery was
epidemic<a id='r804' /><a href='#f804' class='c012'><sup>[804]</sup></a>,—it is but too evident that in many
places, the free settlers, while they retained their
wergyld and perhaps other personal rights, must
yet have been subject like their neighbours to servile
dues and works, and compelled to attend the
lord’s court. Let us only imagine a case which
was probably not uncommon; where the lord, with
his own numerous unfree dependents, occupied
the post of the king’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burggeréfa</span>, the bishop’s
or abbot’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>advocatus</i></span>, and forced himself as their
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> upon the free. What refuge could there
be for these, if he determined to assimilate his
various jurisdictions, and subject all alike to the
convenient machinery of a centralized authority?
They might in vain declare, as did the Northumbrians
of old, that “free by birth and educated
as freemen, they scorned to submit to the tyranny
of any duke,” or count or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>,—but what
remedy had they, when once the defence of the
mutual guarantee was removed? Theoretically of
course they were <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>cyre-lif</i></span>, that is, they could go
away and choose a lord elsewhere: but we may
fairly doubt whether they could practically do this.
New connexions are not easily formed in a state
which enjoys but little means of intercommunication:
what would be sacrificed now without regret,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>assumes a very disproportionate importance at a
period when accumulation is slow, and acquisition
difficult: nor could the expatriated chapman
securely remove his valuables from one place to
another; or even legally withdraw from the district
where he felt himself aggrieved, without the consent
of the very officer from whose unjust exactions
he desired to escape. Under such circumstances
of difficulty, it is to be supposed that, like the prædial
freemen on the country estates, they were
reduced to make the best bargain that they could;
in other words, that they ultimately submitted to
the customs of the place.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover there may have been then, as there
frequently were in the twelfth century, a plurality
of lords each having <em>ban</em> or jurisdiction in particular
localities<a id='r805' /><a href='#f805' class='c012'><sup>[805]</sup></a>, each having different customs to
enforce, separate and conflicting interests to further,
and a separate armament to dispose of. Often, as
we pursue the history of mediæval cities, do we
find king, count, and bishop, with perhaps one or
more barons or castellans, claiming portions of the
town as subject in totality or shares to their several
jurisdictions, imposing heavy capitation-taxes on
their own dependents, establishing hostile tolls
or tariffs to the injury of internal traffic, warring
with one another, from motives of pride or hate,
ambition or avarice, and dragging their reluctant
quotas of the city into internecine hostilities, ruinous
to the interests of all. And then, if strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>enough, among them all subsists a corporation of
burgesses, perhaps a turbulent mob of handicrafts,
distributed in gylds or mysteries, with their deacons,
common-chests, banners, and barricades:—freer
than the old serfs were, but unfree still as
regards the corporation: for the full burgesses have
made alliances with the nobles, have enrolled the
nobles as burgesses in their <em>Hanse</em>, and have become
themselves an aristocracy as compared with
the democracy of the crafts. Or the corporation of
freemen may have elected a noble <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>advocatus</i></span>, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Vogt</em></span>
or Patron, to be the constable of their castle, and to
lead their militia against his brethren by birth and
rivals in estate. Or they may have coalesced with
the crafts in a bond of union for general liberation:—unhappily
too rare a case, for even those old burgesses
sometimes forgot their own origin, and blundered
into the belief that liberty meant privilege<a id='r806' /><a href='#f806' class='c012'><sup>[806]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The misery and mischief of this state of things
were not so prominent among the Anglosaxons,
because the subdivision of powers was much less
than where the principles of feudality prevailed,
and the lords and castellans were not numerous.
Nor were the guarantees which the tithings and
gyldships offered, and which were secured by the
popular election of officers, at any time entirely
devoid of their original force. History therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>records no instances of such painful struggles as
marked the progress of the continental cities, or
even of our own subsequent to the Norman conquest.
But we are nevertheless not without examples
of towns in which the powers of government
were unequally divided: where the king, the bishop
and the burgesses, or the king and bishop alone,
shared in the civil and criminal jurisdiction. In
these the burh, properly so called, or fortification,
often formed part of the city walls, or commanded
the approaches to the market. In it sat the royal
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burhgeréfa</span> and administered justice to the freemen;
while the unfree also appeared in his court, and
became gradually confounded with the free in his
sócn or jurisdiction. On the other hand the bishop,
through his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sócnegeréfa</span>, judged and taxed and governed
his own particular dependents: unless the
power of the king had been such as to unite all the
inhabitants in one body under the authority of the
royal thane who exercised the palatine functions.
Even in the burgmót of the freemen did the royal
and episcopal reeves appear as assessors, to watch
over the interests of their respective employers,
and add a specious, but little suspected, show of
authority to the acts of the corporation.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are still fortunately able to give some account
of the growth of various English towns,
which seem to have arisen after the close of the
Danish wars, and the successive victories of Ælfred’s
children, Eádweard king of Wessex, and
Æðelflǽd, duchess of Mercia.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the treaty of peace between Ælfred and Guðorm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>a very considerable tract of country in the
north and east of England was surrendered to the
latter and his Scandinavian allies. It is clear that
from very early periods this district had contained
important cities and fortresses, but many of these
had probably perished during the wars which expelled
the Northumbrian and Mercian kings, and
finally reduced their territories under the arms of
the Danish invaders. The efforts of Ælfred had
indeed succeeded in saving his ancestral kingdoms
of Wessex and Kent, and by the articles of Wedmor
he had become possessed of a valuable part of
Mercia, between the Severn, the Ouse, the Thames
and the Watling-street. To the east and north of
these lines however, the Scandinavians had settled,
dividing the lands, for the most part denuded of
their Saxon population, or occupied by Saxons who
had submitted to the invader and made common
cause with him, against a king of Wessex to whom
they owed no allegiance. The Eastanglians and a
portion of the Northumbrians had adopted the
kingly form of government; but there were still
independent populations in those districts following
their national Jarls, and in the North was a
powerful confederation of five Burghs or cities,
which sometimes included seven, comprising in one
political unity, York, Lincoln, Leicester, Derby,
Nottingham, Stamford and Chester<a id='r807' /><a href='#f807' class='c012'><sup>[807]</sup></a>. The power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>the Scandinavians however was frittered away in
internal quarrels, and those two children of Wessex,
Eádweard and his lion-hearted sister, determined
upon carrying into the country of the Pagans
the sufferings which they had so often inflicted
upon others. A career of conquest was commenced
from the west and the south; place after place
was cleared of the intruding strangers, by men
themselves intruders, but gifted with better fortune;
the Scandinavians were either thrown back over
the Humber, or compelled to submit to Saxon
arms; and the country wrested from them was
secured and bridled by a chain of fortresses erected
and garrisoned by the victors.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the course of this victorious career we learn
that Æðelflǽd erected the following fortresses<a id='r808' /><a href='#f808' class='c012'><sup>[808]</sup></a>:—In
910, the burh at Bremesbyrig: in 912, those at
Scargate and Bridgnorth: in 913, those at Tamworth
and Stafford: in 914, those at Eddisbury
and Warwick: in 915, the fortresses of Cherbury,
Warborough and Runcorn. In 917 she took the
fortified town of Derby; and in 918, Leicester:
and thus, upon the submission of York, in the
same year, broke up the independent organization
of the “Seven Burhs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The evidences of Eádweard’s activity are yet
more numerous. The following burhs or towns
are recorded to have been built by him. In 913,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>the northern burh at Hertford, between the rivers
Mimera, Benefica and Lea: a burh at Witham,
and soon after another on the southern bank of
the Lea. In 918, he constructed burhs, or fortresses,
on both sides of the river at Buckingham.
In 919 he raised the burh on the southern bank
of the Ouse at Bedford. In 921 he fortified Towchester
with a stone wall; and in the same year
he rebuilt the burhs at Huntingdon and Colchester,
and built the burh at Cledemouth. The following
year he built the burh on the southern bank of the
river at Stamford, and repaired the castle of Nottingham.
In 923 he built a fortress at Thelwall,
and repaired one at Manchester. In 924 he built
another castle at Nottingham, on the south bank
of the Trent, over against that which stood on the
northern bank, and threw a bridge between them.
Lastly he went to Bakewell in Derbyshire, where
he built and garrisoned a burh.</p>

<p class='c001'>A large number of these were no doubt merely
castles or fortresses, and some of them, we are
told, received stipendiary garrisons, that is literally,
king’s troops, contradistinguished on the one hand
from the free landowners who might be called upon
under the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>hereban</i></span> to take a turn of duty therein,
and on the other from the unfree tenants, part of
whose rent may have been paid in service behind
the walls. But it is also certain that the shelter
and protection of the castle often produced the
town, and that in many cases the mere sutler’s
camp, formed to supply the needs of the permanent
garrison, expanded into a flourishing centre of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>commerce, guarded by the fortress, and nourished
by the military road or the beneficent river. It is
also probable enough that on many of their sites
towns, or at least royal vills, had previously existed,
and that the population whom war and its
concomitant misery had dispossessed, returned to
their ancient seats, when quiet seemed likely to be
permanently restored.</p>

<p class='c001'>It cannot be doubted that those who were already
congregated, or for the sake of security or gain did
afterwards collect in such places, were subject to
the authority of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burhgeréfa</span> or castellan, and
that thus the burh by degrees became a Palatium
or Pfalz in the German sense of the word. In truth
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>burh</i></span> does originally denote a castle, not a town;
and the latter only comes to be designated by the
word, because a town could hardly be conceived
without a castle,—a circumstance which favours
the account here given of their origin in general.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is certain that the free institutions which have
been described in an earlier part of this chapter,
could not be found in towns, the right to which
must be considered to have been based on conquest,
or which arose around a settlement purely military.
In such places we can expect to find no mint, except
as matter of grant or favour: if there was
watch and ward, it was for the fortress, not the
townsmen: toll there might be—but for the lord
to receive: jurisdiction,—but for the lord to exercise:
market,—but for the lord to profit by: armed
militia,—but for the lord to command. Yet
while the lord was the king, and the town was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>through its connexion with him, brought into close
union with the general state, its own condition was
probably easy, and its civic relations not otherwise
than beneficial to the republic. In such circumstances
a town is only one part of a system; nor
is a royal landlord compelled to rack the tenants
of a single estate for a fitting subsistence: the
shortcoming of one is balanced by the superfluity
of other sources of wealth. The owner of
the small flock is ever the closest shearer. But
even on this account, when once the towns became
seigneurial, their own state was not so happy, nor
was their relation to the country at large beneficial
to the full extent. But all general observations
of this character do not explain or account
for the separate cases. It is clear that everything
which we have to say upon this subject will depend
entirely upon what we may learn to have been the
character of any particular person or class of persons
at any given time. The lord or Seigneur may
have ruled well; that is, he may have seen that
his own best interests were inseparably bound up
with the prosperity, the peace and the rational
freedom of his dependents; and that both he and
they would flourish most, when the mutual well-being
was guarded by a harmonious common action,
founded upon the least practicable sacrifice
of individual interests. Thus he may have contented
himself with the legal capitation-tax, or even
relinquished it altogether: he may have exacted
only moderate and reasonable tolls, trusting wisely
to a consequent increase of traffic, and rewarded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>a rapid advance in wealth and power: he may have
given a just and generous protection in return for
submission and alliance; have supported his townsmen
in their public buildings, roads, wharves,
canals, and other laudable undertakings. Nay,
when the re-awakened spirit of self-government
grew strong, and the whole mighty mass of mediæval
society heaved and tossed with the working
of this all-pervading leaven, we have even seen
Seigneurs aiding their serf-townsmen to swear and
maintain a “Communa,”—that institution so detested
and savagely persecuted by popes, barons
and bishops,—so hypocritically blamed, but so
lukewarmly pursued by kings, who found it their
gain to have the people on their side against the
nobles<a id='r809' /><a href='#f809' class='c012'><sup>[809]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But unhappily there is another side to the picture:
the lord may have ruled ill, and often did so
rule, for class-prejudices and short-sighted selfish
views of personal interest drove him to courses fatal
to himself and his people. When this was the case,
there was but one miserable alternative, revolt, and
ruin either for the lord, the city, or both,—in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>former case possibly, in the latter always and certainly
a grievous loss to the republic. But before
this final settlement of the question, how much irreparable
mischief, how much of credit and confidence
shaken, of raw material wasted and destroyed,
of property plundered, of security unsettled,
of internecine hostility engendered, class set
against class, family against family, man against
man! Verily, when we contemplate the misery
which such contests caused from the twelfth to the
fifteenth centuries, we could almost join in the cry
of the Jacquerie, and wish, with the prædial and
urban serfs of old, that the race of Seigneurs had
been swept from the face of the earth; did we not
know that gold must be tried in the fire, that liberty
could grow to a giant’s stature only by passing
through a giant’s struggles.</p>

<p class='c001'>But from this painful school of manhood it
pleased the providence of the Almighty to save our
forefathers; nor does Anglosaxon history record
more than one single instance of those oppressions
or of that resistance, which make up so large and
wretched a portion of the history of other lands<a id='r810' /><a href='#f810' class='c012'><sup>[810]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Suffering enough they had to bear, but it was at
the hands of invading strangers, not of those who
were born beneath the same skies and spake with
the same tongue. The power of the national institutions
was too general, too deeply rooted, to be
shaken by the efforts of a class; nor does it appear
that that class itself attempted at any time an
undue exercise of authority. One ill-advised duke
did indeed raise a fierce rebellion by his misgovernment;
but even here national feeling was probably
at work, and the Northumbrians rose less against
the bad ruler, than the intrusive Westsaxon: the
interests of Morcar’s family were more urgent than
the crimes of Tostig. Yet these may have been
grave, for he was repudiated even by those of his
own class, and the strong measure of his deprivation
and outlawry was concurred in by his brother
Harald.</p>

<p class='c001'>In addition to the natural mode by which the
authority of a lord became established in a town
built on his demesne, the privileges of lordship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>were occasionally transferred from one person to
another. Like other royalties, the rights of the
crown over taxation, tolls or other revenues, might
be made matter of grant. The following document
illustrates the manner in which a portion of the
seigneurial rights was thus alienated in favour of
the bishop of Worcester. It is a grant made by
Æðelrǽd and Æðelflǽd to their friend Werfrið,
about the end of the ninth century<a id='r811' /><a href='#f811' class='c012'><sup>[811]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To Almighty God, true Unity and holy Trinity
in heaven, be praise and glory and rendering
of thanks, for all his benefits bestowed upon us!
Firstly for whose love, and for St. Peter’s and the
church at Worcester, and at the request of Werfrið
the bishop, their friend, Æðelrǽd the ealdorman
and Æðelflǽd commanded the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>burh</i></span> at Worcester
to be built, and eke God’s praise to be there
upraised. And now they make known by this
charter that of all the rights which appertain to
their lordship, both in market and in street, within
the byrig and without, they grant half to God and
St. Peter and the lord of the church; that those
who are in the place may be the better provided,
that they may thereby in some sort easier aid the
brotherhood, and that their remembrance may be
the firmer kept in mind, in the place, as long as
God’s service is done within the minster. And
Werfrið the bishop and his flock have appointed
this service, before the daily one, both during their
lives and after, to sing at matins, vespers and ‘undernsong,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>the psalm De Profundis, during their
lives; and after their death, Laudate Dominum;
and every Saturday, in St. Peter’s church, thirty
psalms, and a mass for them whether alive or dead.
Æðelrǽd and Æðelflǽd proclaim, that they have
thus granted with good-will to God and St. Peter,
under witness of Ælfred the king and all the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>witan</i></span>
in Mercia; excepting that the wain-shilling and
load-penny<a id='r812' /><a href='#f812' class='c012'><sup>[812]</sup></a> are to go to the king’s hand, as they
always did, from Saltwíc: but as for everything
else, as <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>landfeoh</i></span><a id='r813' /><a href='#f813' class='c012'><sup>[813]</sup></a>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>fihtwite</i></span>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>stalu</i></span>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wohceápung</i></span>, and
all the customs from which any fine may arise, let
the lord of the church have half of it, for God’s
sake and St. Peter’s, as it was arranged about the
market and the streets; and without the marketplace,
let the bishop enjoy his rights, as of old our
predecessors decreed and privileged. And Æðelrǽd
and Æðelflǽd did this by witness of Ælfred the
king, and by witness of those witan of the Mercians
whose names stand written hereafter; and in
the name of God Almighty they abjure all their
successors never to diminish these alms which they
have granted to the church for God’s love and St.
Peter’s!”</p>

<p class='c001'>A valuable instrument is this, and one which
supplies matter for reflection in various ways. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>royalties conveyed are however alone what must
occupy our attention here. These are, a land-tax,
paid no doubt from every hide which belonged to
the jurisdiction of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burhgeréfa</span>, and which was
thus probably levied beyond the city walls, in small
outlying hamlets and villages, which were not included
in any territorial hundred, but did suit and
service to the burhmót. And next we find the lord
in possession of what we should now call the police,
inflicting fines for breaches of the peace, theft, and
contravention of the regulations laid down for the
conduct of the market. And this market in Worcester
was not the people’s, but the king’s, seeing
that not only are the bishop’s rights, beyond its
limits, carefully distinguished, but that Æðelred
grants half the customs within it, that is, half the
tolls and taxes, to the bishop. In this way was
an authority established concurrent with the king’s
or duke’s, and exercised no doubt by the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">biscopes
geréfa</span>, as the royal right was by the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cyninges</span> or
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ealdormannes burhgeréfa</span>. Nor were its results unfavourable
to the prosperity of the city: there is
evidence on the contrary that in process of time,
the people and their bishop came to a very good
understanding, and that the Metropolis of the West
grew to be a wealthy, powerful and flourishing
place: so much so that, when in the year 1041
Hardacnut attempted to levy some illegal or unpopular
tax, the citizens resisted, put the royal commissioners
to death, and assumed so determined
an attitude of rebellion, that a large force of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Húscarlas</i></span>
and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Hereban</i></span>, under the principal military chiefs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>of England, was found necessary to reduce them.
Florence of Worcester, who relates the occurrence
in detail<a id='r814' /><a href='#f814' class='c012'><sup>[814]</sup></a>, says that the city was burnt and plundered.
From his narrative it seems not improbable
that the whole outbreak was connected with
the removal of a popular bishop from his see in the
preceding year.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is another important document of nearly
the same period as the grant to Werfrið, by which
Eádweard the son of Ælfred gave all the royal rights
of jurisdiction in Taunton to the see of Winchester<a id='r815' /><a href='#f815' class='c012'><sup>[815]</sup></a>.
He freed the land from every burthen, except
the universal three, whether they were royal, fiscal,
comitial or other secular taxations: he granted
that all the bishop’s men, noble or ignoble, resiant
upon the aforesaid land, should have every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>privilege and right which was enjoyed by the king’s
men, resiant in his royal fiscs<a id='r816' /><a href='#f816' class='c012'><sup>[816]</sup></a>, and that all secular
jurisdiction should be administered for the bishop’s
benefit, as fully as it was elsewhere executed for
the king’s. Moreover he attached for ever to Winchester
the market-tolls (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">villae mercimonium,
quod anglice</span> <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ðæs túnes cýping</span> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">adpellatur</span>”), together
with every civic <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>census</i></span>, tax or payment.
Whatsoever had heretofore been the king’s was
henceforth to belong to the bishop of Winchester.
And that these were valuable rights, producing a
considerable income, must be concluded from the
large estates which bishop Denewulf and his chapter
thought it advisable to give the king in exchange,
and which comprised no less than sixty
hides of land in several parcels. The bishops, it is
to be presumed, henceforth governed Taunton by
their own <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>, to whom the grant itself must be
construed to have conveyed plenary jurisdiction,
that is the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>blut-ban</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ius gladii</i></span>, the supreme criminal
as well as civil justice.</p>

<p class='c001'>These examples will suffice to show in what manner
seigneurial rights grew up in certain towns, and
how they were exercised. From the account thus
given we may also see the difference which existed
between such a city and one founded originally
upon a system of free gylds. These associations
placed the men of London in a position to
maintain their own rights both against king and
bishop, and indeed it is evident from the ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Judicia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Civitatis</span>’ itself, that the bishops united with the
citizens in the establishment of their free communa
under Æðelstán. We are not very clearly informed
what was the earliest mode of government in London;
but, from a law of Hloðhære, it is probable
that it was presided over by a royal reeve, in the
seventh century. The sixteenth chapter of that
prince’s law provides that, when a man of Kent
makes any purchase in Lundenwíc, he is to have
the testimony of two or three credible men, or of
the king’s wícgeréfa<a id='r817' /><a href='#f817' class='c012'><sup>[817]</sup></a>. In the ninth century, when
Kent and its confederation had passed into the
hands of the royal family of the Gewissas, London
may possibly have vindicated some portion of independence.
It had previously lain within the nominal
limits at least of the Mercian authority<a id='r818' /><a href='#f818' class='c012'><sup>[818]</sup></a>: but
the victories of Ecgberht and the subsequent invasions
of the Northmen destroyed the Mercian
power, and in all likelihood left the city to provide
for itself and its own freedom. We know that it
suffered severely in those invasions, but we have
slight record of any attempt to relieve it from their
assaults, which might imply an interest in its welfare,
on the part of any particular power. In the
year 886 however, we learn, Ælfred, victorious on
every point, turned his attention to London, whose
fortifications he rebuilt, and which he re-annexed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>to Mercia, now constituted as a duchy under Æðelred<a id='r819' /><a href='#f819' class='c012'><sup>[819]</sup></a>.
On the death of this prince, Eádweard seized
Oxford and London into his own hands, and it
is reasonable to suppose that he governed these
cities by <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burhgeréfan</span> of his own<a id='r820' /><a href='#f820' class='c012'><sup>[820]</sup></a>. But very shortly
after we find the important document, which I
have already mentioned, the so-called ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Judicia Civitatis,</span>’
or Dooms of London, which proves clearly
enough the elasticity of a great trading community,
the readiness with which a city like London could
recover its strength, and the vigour with which its
mixed population could carry out their plans of
self-government and independent existence. Henceforward
we find the citizens for the most part under
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">portgeréfan</span> or portreeves of their own<a id='r821' /><a href='#f821' class='c012'><sup>[821]</sup></a>, to whom
the royal writs are directed, as in counties they are
to the sheriffs. We must not however suppose that
at this early period constitutional rights were so
perfectly settled as to be beyond the possibility of
infringement. Circumstances, whose record now
escapes us, may sometimes have occurred which
abridged the franchise of particular cities: we
cannot conclude that the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Portgeréfa</span> was always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>freely elected by the citizens; for in some places
we hear of “royal” portreeves<a id='r822' /><a href='#f822' class='c012'><sup>[822]</sup></a>, from which it may
be argued either that the king had made the
appointment by his own authority, or, what is
far from improbable, that he had concurred with
the citizens in the election. Moreover the direction
of writs to noblemen of high rank, even in
London, seems to imply that, on some occasions,
either the king had succeeded in seizing the liberties
of the city into his own hand, or that the elected
officers were sometimes taken from the class of
powerful ministerials, having high rank and station
in the royal household<a id='r823' /><a href='#f823' class='c012'><sup>[823]</sup></a>. Where there existed
clubs or gylds of the free citizens, we may also believe
that similar associations were established by
the lords and their dependents, either as a means of
balancing the popular power, or at least of sharing
in the benefits of an association which secured the
rights and position of the free men; and thus, the
same document which reveals to us the existence
of the “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Ingang burhware</span>” or “burghers’
club” of Canterbury, tells us also of the “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Cnihta
gyld,</span>” or “Sodality of young nobles” in the same
city<a id='r824' /><a href='#f824' class='c012'><sup>[824]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>Two points necessarily arrest our attention in
considering the case of every city; the first of these
is the internal organization, on which the freedom
of the inhabitants itself depends: the second is the
relation the city stands in to the public law, that
is to say, its particular position toward the state.
The Anglosaxon laws do contain a few provisions
destined to regulate the intercourse between the
townspeople and the country: for example we may
refer to the laws which regulate the number of
mints allowed to each city. In the tenth century
it was settled that each burh might have one,—and
from this very fact it is clear that “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burh</span>” was
then a legal term having a fixed and definite meaning,—while
a few cities were favoured with a larger
number. The names of the places so distinguished
are preserved, and from the regulations affecting
them in this respect we may form a conclusion as
to their comparative importance. Under Æðelstân
we find the following arrangement:—At Canterbury
were to be seven moneyers; four for the
king, two for the bishop, one for the abbot. At
Rochester three; two for the king, one for the
bishop. At London eight. At Winchester six. At
Lewes, Hampton, Wareham, Exeter and Shaftsbury,
two moneyers to each town. At Hastings,
Chichester, and at the other burhs, one to each
town<a id='r825' /><a href='#f825' class='c012'><sup>[825]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is right to observe that all these places are in
Æðelstán’s peculiar kingdom, south of the Thames,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>and that his legislation takes no notice of the Mercian,
Eastanglian or Northumbrian territories. But
half a century later, it was ordered that no man
should have a mint save the king, and that any
person who wrought money without the precincts
of a burh, should be liable to the penalties of forgery.
The inconvenience of this was however too
great, and by the ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Instituta Londoniae</span>,’ each principal
city (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">summus portus</span>”) was permitted to
have three, and every other burh one moneyer<a id='r826' /><a href='#f826' class='c012'><sup>[826]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, the difficulty of guarding against theft,
especially in respect to cattle, the universal vice
of a semi-civilized people,—led to more than one
attempt to prohibit all buying and selling except
in towns; and this of itself seems to imply that
they were numerously distributed over the face of
the country. But this provision, however beneficial
to the lords of such towns, was too contrary to the
general convenience, and seems to have been soon
relinquished as impracticable. The enactments on
the subject appear to have been abrogated almost
as soon as made<a id='r827' /><a href='#f827' class='c012'><sup>[827]</sup></a>: but the machinery by which it
was proposed to carry their provisions into effect
are of considerable interest. In each burh, according
to its size, a certain number of the townspeople
were to be elected, who might act as witnesses in
every case of bargain and sale,—whom both parties
on occasion would be bound to call to warranty,
and whose decision or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>veredictum</i></span> in the premises
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>would be final. It was intended that in every larger
burh (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">summus portus</span>”) there should be thirty-three
such elective officers, and in every hundred
twelve or more, by whose witness every bargain was
to be sanctioned, whether in a burh or a wapentake.
They were to be bound by oath to the faithful
discharge of their duty. The law of Eádgár
says: “Let every one of them, on his first election
as a witness, take an oath that, neither for profit,
nor fear, nor favour, will he ever deny that which
he did witness, nor affirm aught but what he did
see and hear. And let there be two or three such
sworn men as witnesses to every bargain<a id='r828' /><a href='#f828' class='c012'><sup>[828]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The words of this law seem to imply that the
appointment was to be a permanent one; and it
is only natural to suppose that these “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geǽðedan</span>
men,” <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jurati</i></span>, or jurors, would become by degrees
a settled urban magistracy. We see in them the
germ of a municipal institution, a sworn corporation,
assessors in some degree of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> or
the later mayor<a id='r829' /><a href='#f829' class='c012'><sup>[829]</sup></a>. They were evidently the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">boni
et legales homines,</span>” the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">testes credibiles</span>,” “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ða
gódan men</span>,” “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">dohtigan men</span>,” and so forth, of
various documents, the “Scabini,” “Schoppen”
or “Echevins,” so familiar to us in the history
of mediæval towns, which had any pretensions to
freedom. They necessarily constituted a magistracy,
and gradually became the centre round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>which the rights and privileges of the municipality
clustered.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is to be regretted that we have so little record
of the internal organization of these municipal bodies,
which must nevertheless have existed during
the flourishing period of the Anglosaxon rule. Of
Ealdormen in the towns, and in our modern sense,
there naturally is, and could be, no trace: that
dignity was very different from anything like the
geréfscipe of a city, however wealthy and influential
this might be: but the ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Instituta Londoniae</span>’
mention one or two subordinate officers: in these,
beside the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Portgeréfa</span>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Burhgeréfa</span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Wícgeréfa</span>,—names
which all appear to denote one officer, the
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praepositus civitatis</span>,”—we are told of a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Túngeréfa</span>,
who had a right to enquire into the payment
of the customs<a id='r830' /><a href='#f830' class='c012'><sup>[830]</sup></a>; and also of a Caccepol, catch-poll
or beadle, who appears to have been the collector<a id='r831' /><a href='#f831' class='c012'><sup>[831]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The archæologist, not less than the historian,
has reason to lament that no remains from the past
survive to teach us the local distribution of an Anglosaxon
town. Yet some few hints are nevertheless
supplied which enable us to form a faint image
of what it may have been. It is probable that the
different trades occupied different portions of the
area, which portions were named from the occupations
of their inhabitants. In the middle ages
these several parts of the city were often fortified
and served as strongholds, behind whose defences,
or sallying forth from which, the crafts fought the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>battle of democracy against the burgesses or the
neighbouring lords. We have evidence that streets,
which afterwards did, and do yet, bear the names
of particular trades or occupations, were equally so
designated before the Norman conquest, in several
of our English towns. It is thus only that we can
account for such names as Fellmonger, Horsemonger
and Fleshmonger, Shoewright and Shieldwright,
Tanner and Salter Streets, and the like,
which have long ceased to be exclusively tenanted
by the industrious pursuers of those several avocations.
Let us place a cathedral and a guildhall
with its belfry in the midst of these, surround them
with a circuit of walls and gates, and add to them
the common names of North, South, East and West,
or Northgate, Southgate, Eastgate and Westgate
Streets,—here and there let us fix the market and
its cross, the dwellings of the bishop and his clergy,
the houses of the queen and perhaps the courtiers,
of the principal administrative officers and of the
leading burghers<a id='r832' /><a href='#f832' class='c012'><sup>[832]</sup></a>,—above all, let us build a stately
fortress, to overawe or to defend the place, to be
the residence of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> and his garrison, and
the site of the courts of justice,—and we shall have
at least a plausible representation of a principal
Anglosaxon city. Much as it is to be regretted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>that we now possess no ancient maps or plans
which would have thrown a valuable light upon
this subject, yet the guidance here and there supplied
by the names of the streets themselves,
and the foundations of ancient buildings yet to be
traced in them, coupled with fragmentary notices
in the chroniclers, do sometimes enable us to catch
glimpses as it were of this history of the past. The
giant march of commercial prosperity has crumbled
into dust almost every trace of what our brave
and good forefathers looked upon with pardonable
pride: but the principles which animated them,
still in a great degree regulate the lives of us their
descendants; and if we exult in the conviction that
our free municipal institutions are the safeguard
of some of our most cherished liberties, let us remember
those to whom we owe them, and study
to transmit unimpaired to our posterity an inheritance
which we have derived from so remote an
ancestry.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r759'>759</a>. It is clear that Caesar was not greatly harassed in his march towards
the ford of the Thames near Chertsey; and if, as is probable, his
advance disarmed the Cantii generally, or compelled the more warlike
of their body to retire upon the force of Cassivelaunus, concentrated on
the left bank of the river, we can understand what would otherwise
seem a very dangerous movement,—a march into Surrey, leaving London
unoccupied on the right flank. Thus it seems to me that the fact
of Caesar’s not noticing the city may be more readily explained by its
not lying within the scope of his man&oelig;uvres, than by its not existing
in his time. And indeed it is probable that just here some portion
of his memoirs has been lost: for in the nineteenth chapter of the
fifth book, he distinctly says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cassivelaunus, <em>ut supra demonstravimus</em>,
omni deposita spe contentionis,</span>” etc.; but nothing now remains
in what we possess, to which these words can possibly be referred.
Caesar’s Commentaries were the private literary occupation of the great
soldier in peaceful times, and we cannot attribute this contradiction
in his finished work to carelessness.</p>

perfect condition. The remains at Lincoln and Old Verulam enable us
to trace the ancient sites with precision, and in the immediate neighbourhood
of the latter town the foundations of a large theatre are yet
preserved. The plough still brings to light the remains of Roman
villas and the details of Roman cultivation throughout the valley of the
Severn. It is impossible here to enumerate all the places where the
discovery of coins, inscriptions, works of art and utility or ruins of
buildings attest a continued occupation of the site and a peaceful settlement.
Many archæological works, the result of modern industry,

<p class='c001'><a href='#r767'>767</a>. Tacitus gives us an insight into some of the gratuitous insults and
vexations inflicted upon the British provincials, while he describes the
reforms introduced by Agricola into these branches of the public service.
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ceterum animorum provinciae prudens, simulque doctus per
aliena experimenta, parum profici armis, si iniuriae sequerentur, causas

tributo gravius tolerabantur: namque per ludibrium adsidere clausis
horreis, et emere ultro frumenta, ac vendere pretio cogebantur: devortia
itinerum et longinquitas regionum indicebatur, ut civitates a
proximis hybernis in remota et avia deferrent, donec, quod omnibus in
promtu erat, paucis lucrosum fieret.</span>” Tac. Agric. xix. The same
grave historian attributes the fierce insurrection under Boadicea to the
tyrannous conduct of the Legati and Procuratores of the province, and
the insolent conduct of their subordinates. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britanni agitare inter se

to the same facts that he describes the Britons as peaceable and well disposed
to discharge the duties laid upon <a id='corr273.1.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='then'>them</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_273.1.24'><ins class='correction' title='then'>them</ins></a></span>, if they are only spared
insult. Tac. Agric. xiii. Xiphilinus, who though a late writer is valuable
inasmuch as he represents Dio Cassius, describes some of the intolerable
atrocities which drove the Iceni into rebellion, destroyed Camelodunum
and Verulamium, and led in those cities and in London to the
slaughter of nearly seventy thousand citizens and allies. Deep as was
the wrong done to the family of Prasutagus, he is no doubt right in
attributing the general exasperation mainly to the confiscation of the
lands which Claudius Caesar had granted to the chiefs, and which the
procurator Catus Decianus attempted to call in. Πρόφασις δὲ τοῦ

to declare that they were charged with a poll-tax, so severely exacted
that an account was required even of the dead: οὐδὲ γὰρ τὸ τελευτῆσαι

These accusations put into the mouths of the personages themselves,
must not be taken to be exaggerated statements without foundation:
they are the confessions of the historians, which sometimes perhaps they
lacked courage to make in another form. The sudden and violent
calling in of large sums which Seneca had forced upon the British
chiefs in expectation of enormous interest, was another cause of the war:
διά τε οὖν τοῦτο, καὶ ὅτι ὁ Σενέκας χιλίας σφίσι μυριάδας ἄκουσιν ἐπὶ
χρησταῖς ἐλπίσι τόκων δανείσας, ἔπειτ’ ἀθρόας τε ἅμα αὐτὰς καὶ βιαίως
εἰσέπρασσεν. The Roman mortgages in Britain were enormous, yet
easily explained. The procurator made an extravagant demand: the
native state could not pay it; but the procurator had a Roman friend
who would advance it upon good security, etc. Similar things have
taken place in <em>Zemindaries</em> of later date than the British. For the
references above see Joan. Xiphil. Epitome Dionis, <cite>Nero</cite> vi.</p>

crowded into cities, and the country was deserted. This was not the
result of a healthy manufacturing or commercial movement, but of a
state of universal distraction and insecurity. Had the cultivation of
the land ceased through a prudent calculation of political economy,
we should not have heard of compulsory tillage.</p>

remains of their buildings extant when he wrote. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Romani Britanniam
... magna dignatione coluere; ut et in annalibus legere, et in veterum
aedificiorum vestigiis est videre.</span>” Gest. Reg. lib. i. cp. 1. The
following is his account of the state in which the island was left: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ita
cum tyranni nullum in agris praeter semibarbaros, nullum in urbibus
praeter ventri deditos reliquissent, Britannia omni patrocinio iuvenilis
vigoris viduata, omni exercitio artium exinanita, conterminarum gentium
inhiationi diu obnoxia fuit. Siquidem, e vestigio, Scottorum et

prorsus omnia ferro incendioque vastata; turbati insulani, qui

enough to do to defend herself, for those were the days of Alaric and
Attila. The emptying the island of all the fighting men by Maximus
is a very ancient fiction. Archbishop Usher makes him carry over to
the continent thirty thousand soldiers, and one hundred thousand
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>plebeii</i></span>, which have settled in Armorica. Antiq. Eccles. Brittan. pp. 107,
108. We may admit the number of the soldiery; the Roman force,
with the levies, probably amounted to as many. But who were the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>plebeii</i></span>? Beda gives a similar account of the condition of Britain: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exin

How could Cúðwulf possibly have man&oelig;uvred such a force as he commanded,

if those places were capable of offering any kind of resistance? If they

opinion that the German conquerors always destroyed the cities which
they found. But the arguments which he adduces appear to me insufficient
in themselves, and to be refuted by the obvious facts of the case.
See his Der Lex Salica alter und Heimath, p. 160. The passages in

never be suffered to fall in arrear. It is the only rent which cannot be
fetched up. Old Verulam was first dismantled because Ealdred, a

In the ninth century a Danish army pressed by the Saxons took refuge

seeing the weakness of the wall: as Asser says, “Murum frangere

case of Bury St. Edmund’s. The following passage is cited from
Domesday (371, b) in the notes to Mr. Rokewode’s edition of Jocelyn
de Brakelonde. “In the town where the glorious king and martyr St.
Edmund lies buried, in the time of king Edward, Baldwin the abbot
held for the sustenance of the monks one hundred and eighteen men;
and they can sell and give their land; and under them fifty-two <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bordarii</i></span>,
from whom the abbot can have help; fifty-four freemen poor
enough; forty-three living upon alms; each of them has one <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bordarius</i></span>.
There are now two mills and two store-ponds or fish-ponds. This town
was then worth ten pounds, now twenty. It has in length one leuga
and a half, and in breadth as much. And it pays to the geld, when
payable in the hundred, one pound. And then the issues therefrom
are sixty pence towards the sustenance of the monks; but this is to be
understood of the town as it was in the time of king Edward, if it so
remains; for now it contains a greater circuit of land, the which was
then ploughed and sown; where, one with another, there are thirty
priests, deacons and clerks, twenty-eight nuns and poor brethren who
pray daily for the king and all Christian people; eighty less five bakers,
brewers, seamsters, fullers, shoemakers, tailors, cooks, porters, serving-men;
and these all daily minister to the saint, and abbot and brethren.
Besides whom there are thirteen upon the land of the reeve, who have
their dwellings in the same town, and under them five <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bordarii</i></span>. Now
there are thirty-four persons owing military service, taking French and
English together, and under them twenty-two <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bordarii</i></span>. Now in the
whole there are three hundred and forty-two dwellings in the demesne
of the land of St. Edmund, which was arable in the time of king Edward.”

of the population; as, for example, the richer inhabitants, a special
burgher’s club. The argument in the text is no way affected by the
pre-eminence of some particular association among the rest, and an
“<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Ingang burhware,</span>” even if a distinct thing, only proves the existence
of a “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burhwaru</span>” besides. However it is probable that there was a

his far less sound production the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conquête de l’Angleterre par les

of the French Communes to our own or those of Flanders,
which had frequently a very different origin. See Warnkönig, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist.

<p class='c001'><a href='#r809'>809</a>. History furnishes notable instances of what has been put here
merely hypothetically. The earls of Flanders were honourably distinguished
among all the European potentates by the liberal manner
in which they treated their subjects. The appendix to this chapter
contains some of the earliest charters which they granted to their towns,
and these fully explain the wealth, power and happiness of Flanders in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. And notwithstanding what I
have said in the text, and which is justified by the conduct of the bishops
in some parts of Europe, it must be admitted that the clergy were
generally just and merciful lords, as far as the material well-being of
their dependents was concerned. The German proverb says: “’Tis
good to live under the crozier.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r810'>810</a>. Even under the Norman kings, the condition of this country seems
to have been comparatively easy. Its darkest moments were during the
wars of Stephen and Henry Plantagenet. The position then assumed
by the seigneurs or castellans and its results are thus well described by
an old chronicler:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sane inter partes diu certatum est, alternante fortuna;
sed tunc quodammodo remissiores motus esse coeperunt: quod
tamen Angliae non cessit in bonum, eo quod tot erant reges quot domini
castellorum, habentes singuli numisma proprium et more regis
subditos iudicantes. Et quia magnates terrae sic invicem excellere
satagebant, eo quod nullus in alterum habebat imperium, mox inter se
disceptantes rapinis et incendiis clarissimas regiones corruperunt, in
tantum quod omne robur panis fere deperiit.</span>” Walt. Hemingburh,
vulgo Gisseburne, i. 74. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castella quippe studio partium per singulas
provincias surrexerant crebra; erantque in Anglia tot quodammodo
reges, vel potius tyranni, quot castellorum domini, habentes singuli
percussuram proprii numismatis, et potestatem dicendi subditis regio
more iura.</span>” Annal. Trivet. 1147, p. 25. The contemporary Saxon
chronicler gives the most frightful account of the tyrannous exactions
of the castellans, and the tortures they inflicted on the defenceless cultivators.
And this miserable condition of the country is only too obvious
in the words with which the contemporary author of the life of
Stephen commences his work. Gest. Stephani, p. 1 <i>seq.</i> Nor can this

  <h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER VIII. <br /> THE BISHOP.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Whatever variety of form the heathendom of the
Anglosaxons may have assumed in different districts,
we are justified in asserting that a sacerdotal
class existed, and that there were different grades
of rank within it. We hear of priests, and of chief
priests; and it is not unnatural to conclude that to
the latter some pre-eminence in dignity, if not in
power, was conceded over their less-distinguished
colleagues. Similarly, the necessities of internal
government and regulation, and the analogy of secular
administration, had gradually supplied the
Christian communities with a well-organized system
of hierarchy, which commencing with the
lower ministerial functions, passed upward through
the presbyterate, the episcopal and metropolitan
ordinations, and found its culminating point and
completion in the patriarchates of the eastern and
western churches. The paganism of the Old World,
which admitted the participation of different classes
in the public rites of religion, if it did not cause,
could at least easily reconcile itself to, this systematic
division. Our own heathen state is not well
known enough to enable us to affirm as much of
our forefathers; but the immediate foundation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>an episcopal church in all the newly-converted Teutonic
countries, seems to show that no difficulty
existed or was apprehended as to its ready reception.
In England, as elsewhere, the introduction
of Christianity was immediately followed by the
establishment of bishops. But it is necessary to
draw a distinction between the effects of this establishment
in England and in various parts of the
continent. As we pursue the inquiries which necessarily
meet us in investigating the history of
conversion in the West, we are led to a remarkable
fact, viz. that the power of the Roman see was,
generally speaking, most substantially founded by
the efforts and energy of Teutonic prelates; while
a much more steady opposition to its triumph was
offered by the provincials who usually filled the
episcopal office in the cities of Gaul.</p>

<p class='c001'>The apparent strangeness of this however soon
vanishes, when we consider the many grounds upon
which the Gallic churches contested the immediate
supremacy of Rome. The archbishop of Vienne
long claimed the patriarchal authority in Gaul, upon
the same grounds as the bishops of Rome and Constantinople
claimed it in those cities<a id='r833' /><a href='#f833' class='c012'><sup>[833]</sup></a>. Many of
the provincial churches boasted an antiquity hardly
inferior to the Roman, and a foundation not less
illustrious; many had shown in persecution and
suffering a spirit of Christian perseverance and a
steadfastness of faith, which the City itself had not
exceeded in her own hour of trial. Above all,
there continued to exist a vigorous nationality in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>Gaul, however oppressed and bridled by the energy
of the Frankish conquerors, especially in Neustria
or the northern portion of modern France. To this
spirit of nationality, based upon ancient descent
and long familiarity with the civilization of the
Roman empire, and fed in turn by a great amount
of material prosperity, we must refer the complete
dissolution of the Carolingian empire itself, and
the establishment of the counts of Paris as kings
in the western districts of that unwieldy body.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is true that the Western Church did not lay
definite claim to any such total independence as
Cyprian vindicated for his African communities:
the good offices and arbitration of St. Peter’s successor
were sought in disputed and doubtful cases,
even if we cannot admit of positive appeals to the
Roman curia: the bishops of Burgundy, Provence
and Spain, early found that union with the oldest
and most respected church of the West offered an
important defence of orthodoxy threatened by the
Arian and semi-Arian dogma of the barbarians who
had wrested those fine provinces from the empire:
and the popes were not unwilling to encourage a
tendency which helped to realize the idea of a pre-eminence
in their church over all the Christian
communities.<a id='r834' /><a href='#f834' class='c012'><sup>[834]</sup></a> The institution of Missi, or special
commissioners, was familiar: they adopted it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>at a very early period we find papal vicars exercising
some sort of authority in Gaul, and perhaps
even in Britain.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conversion of Clovis to the orthodox faith,
instead of that which he might have learned from
his Arian neighbours, was not only a source of
power and importance to the Catholic bishops of
Gaul, but ultimately of the greatest moment to the
bishop of Rome. We must admit that under the
Merwingian kings, the popes enjoyed some authority
and great consideration in Gaul, though not
enough to endanger the independence and freedom
of the Gallican church: but under the family of
Pipin they necessarily occupied a very different
position. For during the earlier years of the imperial
constitution, Rome was a city, and its bishop
to a certain extent an officer, of the empire, and
the power and influence of the popes was advanced
by the Frankish emperor as best might suit his
own purposes. It is assuredly not true that under
Charlemagne those bishops ventured upon any of
the usurpations which they succeeded in substantiating
under later emperors.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the reign of Hluduuig indeed, a pious
but weak prince, they obtained various concessions
which in process of time bore fruit of power<a id='r835' /><a href='#f835' class='c012'><sup>[835]</sup></a>. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>was reserved for later days to witness the triumph
of Roman independence through the combination
of communal with priestly tendencies. This combination
first darkly arose when the nationality of
Rome itself burst forth, encouraged by the vigour
with which the bishop made head against the invading
Saracens in Italy, supported the orthodox
prelates of the southern kingdoms, Arles, Burgundy
and Spain against Arian dukes and governors, and
regulated the internal affairs of the city, neglected
by its Frankish patricians and missi. At this time
too Rome had no competitor: Africa had fallen,
Constantinople had abdicated her imperial position,
the cities and the sees of the East had vanished
together; Rome—at least one of the oldest—was
now unquestionably the most powerful of the Christian
churches. She had all the prestige of the old
empire, and all the support of the new one which
she had helped to found upon the ruins of the old.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this gradual advance and this commanding
power could not at first have been contemplated.
It is a common error to suppose that great results,
which seem necessarily produced by a long series
of combined causes, have from the first been prepared
and foreseen. The spectator in his own
struggle after a logical unity rejects the accidental
and accessory facts, to fix his eyes upon the apparently
essential development; and supposes everything
to have been grasped together, because his
intellect cannot conceive the whole variety of occurrences
without so grasping them. The relations
of Rome with the Franks were hardly the consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>of any deliberate or well-considered plan.
The Frankish kings had been selected as patrons
merely because they could afford the protection
which was looked for in vain from Constantinople,
or indeed any other quarter; and had Italy not
been overrun by Germanic invaders of various race,
from whose power there seemed no refuge, save in
other and still more barbarous Germanic defenders,
the Western empire might never have been restored:
but when once it was so restored,—from
the moment when Pope Leo and the Roman municipality
agreed to place the command of the city,
and the rights of the ancient Caesars, in the hands
of a barbarian king,—but one capable of appreciating
and securing all the advantages of his great
position,—Rome itself became not only identified
with the new views, but necessary to their fulfilment<a id='r836' /><a href='#f836' class='c012'><sup>[836]</sup></a>.
Had the new emperor been a Roman, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>had he selected Rome as his residence, and thus
made it the local as well as real and political centre
of his power, the Papacy would probably never
have attained its territorial authority. But the
Frankish king remained true to the habits of his
people and of his predecessors, resided in peaceful
times at Ingleheim or Aix la Chapelle, and spent
years in wandering from one royal vill to another,
or in the duties of active warfare upon the several
confines of his empire; and thus the government
of the eternal city practically fell into the hands of
Frankish officers, dukes, missi, counts palatine, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>ministerials, who gradually proved no match for the
enlightened skill, unwearied diplomacy and increasing
power of the pontiffs, the Roman aristocratic
families, and the resuscitated municipality: yet the
popes had hardly succeeded in attaining to a complete
independence of the German Caesars, when
the son of Hugues, called Capet, expelled the last
Caroling from the soil of France; though in the
course of a policy long inexorably pursued, they
had gone far to prepare for a dismemberment of
the empire which was to be of more important
consequence to the world than even that separation<a id='r837' /><a href='#f837' class='c012'><sup>[837]</sup></a>.
In 956—the year in which Eádwig, the mark
of monkish calumny, came to the throne of England,
the Patrician Octavian, son of Alberic of
Spoleto, and through him grandson of the scandalous
Marozia, caused himself to be elected Pope;
and thus united the highest worldly and spiritual
authorities in the city, concentrating in his own
person all the rights both of the empire and the
papacy<a id='r838' /><a href='#f838' class='c012'><sup>[838]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Three hundred and sixty years earlier, Gregory,
then bishop of Rome, had despatched a missionary
adventure to this country.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>The zeal of modern polemics has dealt more
hardly with Gregory than justice demands<a id='r839' /><a href='#f839' class='c012'><sup>[839]</sup></a>. Who
shall dare to attribute to him, or to any other man,
entire freedom from human error, or total absence
of those faults which, for the very happiness of
man, are found to chequer the most perfect of
human characters? But even if we admit that he
shared, to not less than the usual degree, in the
weakness and selfishness of our nature, it is impossible
to withhold the meed of our admiration
from the man whose intellect could combine, whose
prudence could direct, and whose courage could
cope with, all the details of a conversion such as
that of Saxon England. Let us only consider the
circumstances under which he found himself placed
at home, and we shall the better comprehend the
power of mind which could devise and execute
the vast design of a spiritual colonization, a transplantation
of religion as it were from Rome the
centre, to Britain the extreme, the least known,
and most barbarous point of the ancient empire<a id='r840' /><a href='#f840' class='c012'><sup>[840]</sup></a>.
Temporal as well as spiritual ruler of the city,
abandoned by those miserable intriguers who inherited
from the emperors nothing but their title
and their vices, and pressed on every side by the
vigorous advance of the Langobardic arms, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Gregory’s fate or fortune to pass in the midst of
political excitement a life which he had hoped to
devote to pious meditation. But he possessed a
character capable of moulding itself to all the exigencies
of his situation; whether reluctantly or
not, he flung himself into the gap, and comprehended,
with a perfect singleness of insight, that to
whom belongs the post of greatest honour, on him
lies also the burthen of the greatest toil and greatest
danger. By turns soldier, captain, negotiator,
and priest,—now wielding the pen to instruct, now
the sword to protect or to chastise,—now pouring
passionate exhortations from his pulpit, now providing
for the resources of his commissariat, or superintending
the builders engaged on the material
defences of his walls,—we see in him one of those
men whom troublous times have often educated to
cope with themselves, and whose names have thus
justly become the very landmarks and pivots of
history.</p>

<p class='c001'>A great writer, who sometimes suffers his hostility
against Christianity and its professors to outweigh
the calmer judgment of the historian, has
left us this graphic account of the condition of
Rome at the end of the sixth century<a id='r841' /><a href='#f841' class='c012'><sup>[841]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Amidst the arms of the Lombards, and under
the despotism of the Greeks, we again inquire into
the fate of Rome<a id='r842' /><a href='#f842' class='c012'><sup>[842]</sup></a>, which had reached, about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>close of the sixth century, the lowest period of her
depression. By the removal of the seat of empire,
and the successive loss of the provinces, the sources
of public and private opulence were exhausted; the
lofty tree, under whose shade the nations of the
earth had reposed, was deprived of its leaves and
branches, and the sapless trunk was left to wither
on the ground. The ministers of command and
the messengers of victory no longer met on the
Appian or Flaminian Way, and the hostile approach
of the Lombards was often felt and continually
feared. The inhabitants of a potent and
peaceful capital, who visit without an anxious
thought the garden of the adjoining country, will
faintly picture in their fancy the distress of the
Romans; they shut or opened their gates with a
trembling hand, beheld from the walls the flames
of their houses, and heard the lamentations of their
brethren, who were coupled together like dogs, and
dragged away into distant slavery beyond the sea
and the mountains. Such incessant alarms must
annihilate the pleasures and interrupt the labours
of a rural life; and the Campagna of Rome was
speedily reduced to the state of a dreary wilderness,
in which the land is barren, the waters are impure,
and the air is infectious. Curiosity and ambition
no longer attracted the nations to the capital of the
world: but if chance or necessity directed the steps
of a wandering stranger, he contemplated with horror
the vacancy and solitude of the city, and might
be tempted to ask, Where is the senate, and where
are the people? In a season of excessive rains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>the Tiber swelled above its banks, and rushed with
irresistible violence into the valleys of the seven
hills. A pestilential disease arose from the stagnation
of the deluge, and so rapid was the contagion,
that fourscore persons expired in an hour in
the midst of a solemn procession, which implored
the mercy of heaven<a id='r843' /><a href='#f843' class='c012'><sup>[843]</sup></a>. A society in which marriage
is encouraged and industry prevails, soon repairs
the accidental losses of pestilence and war;
but as the far greater part of the Romans was
condemned to hopeless indigence and celibacy, the
depopulation was constant and visible, and the
gloomy enthusiasts might expect the approaching
failure of the human race<a id='r844' /><a href='#f844' class='c012'><sup>[844]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was in the midst of scenes such as these that
Gregory found time to organize the mission of Augustine
to Britain. In the absence of definite information,
derived from his own account, or the
relations of his friends and contemporaries, it is
impossible to penetrate the motives which led the
pontiff to this step. They have been variously interpreted
by the zeal of opposing historians, who
have construed them by the light of their own prejudices,
in favour of the conflicting interests of
their respective churches. Nor, with such insufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>means, do we attempt to reconcile their differences:
human motives are rarely unmixed,
rarely all good or all evil: it is possible that there
may be some truth in all the conflicting views
which have been taken of this great act; that while
an earnest missionary spirit, and deep feeling of
responsibility, led the Pope to carry the blessings
of an orthodox Christianity to the distant and
benighted tribes of Britain, he may have contemplated—not
without pardonable complacency—the
growth of a church immediately dependent upon
his see for guidance and instruction. It may be
that some lingering whispers of vanity or ambition
spoke of the increase of wealth or dignity or power
which might thus accrue to the patriarchate of the
West. Nay, who shall say that, looking round in
his despair upon Rome itself and the disject members
of its once mighty empire, he may not even
have thought that England, inaccessible from its
seas, and the valour of its denizens, might one day
offer a secure refuge to the last remains of Roman
faith and nationality, and their last, but not least
noble, defender?</p>

<p class='c001'>To the pontiff and the statesman it was not unknown
that the Britannic islands were occupied
by two populations different alike in their descent
and in their fortunes; the elder and the weaker,
of Keltic blood; the younger and the conquering
race, an offshoot of that great Teutonic stock,
whose branches had overspread all the fairest provinces
of the empire, and had now for the most
part adopted something of the civilization, together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>with the profession, of Christianity. He was aware
that commercial intercourse, nay even family alliances,
had already connected the Anglosaxons
with those Franks, who, in opposition to the Arian
Goths, Burgundians and Langobards, had accepted
the form of faith considered orthodox by the Roman
See<a id='r845' /><a href='#f845' class='c012'><sup>[845]</sup></a>. The British church, he no doubt knew, in
common with others which claimed to have been
founded by the Apostles<a id='r846' /><a href='#f846' class='c012'><sup>[846]</sup></a>, still retained some rites
and practices which had either never been sanctioned
or were now abandoned at Rome: but still
the communion of the churches had been maintained
as well as could be expected between such
distant establishments. British bishops had appeared
in the Catholic synods<a id='r847' /><a href='#f847' class='c012'><sup>[847]</sup></a>, and the church of
the Keltic aborigines reverenced with affectionate
zeal the memory of the missionaries whom it
was the boast of Rome to have sent forth for her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>instruction or confirmation in the faith<a id='r848' /><a href='#f848' class='c012'><sup>[848]</sup></a>. On the
other hand, it had reached the ears of the Pope,
that the Germanic conquerors themselves yearned
for the communication of the glad tidings of salvation;
that tolerance was found in at least one
court,—and that, one of preponderating influence;
while an unhappy instinct of national hatred had
induced the British Christians to withhold all attempts
to spread the Gospel among their heathen
neighbours<a id='r849' /><a href='#f849' class='c012'><sup>[849]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Under these circumstances, in the year 596, at
the very moment when the ancient metropolis of
the world seemed on the point of falling under the
yoke of the Langobards, Augustine and his forty
companions set out to carry the faith to the extreme
islands of the West,—a deed as heroic as
when Scipio marched for Zama, and left the terrible
Carthaginian thundering at the gates of the
city. Furnished with letters of introduction to
facilitate their passage through Gaul, where they
were to provide themselves with interpreters, and
where, in the event of success, Augustine was to
receive episcopal consecration, the adventurers
finally landed in Kent, experienced a gentle reception
from Æðelberht, and obtained permission to
preach the faith among his subjects. In an incredibly
short space of time—if we may credit the
earliest historian of the Anglosaxon church—their
efforts were crowned with success in the more
important districts of the island; Canterbury, Rochester
and London received the distinction of
episcopal sees; swarms of energetic missionaries
from Rome, from Gaul, from Burgundy, followed
on their track, eager to aid their labours, and share
their triumph; and at length the Keltic Scots
themselves, emulous of their successes, or awakened,
though late, to a sense of their own culpable
neglect, entered vigorously upon the vacant field,
and preached the Gospel to the pagan tribes north
of the Humber, and in the central provinces of
England. The progress of the new creed was not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>however, one unchequered triumph: in Wales and
Scotland the embittered Kelts refused not only
canonical submission to the missionary archbishop,
but even Catholic communion with his neophytes<a id='r850' /><a href='#f850' class='c012'><sup>[850]</sup></a>.
In Eastanglia, Essex, nay Kent itself, apostacy followed
upon the death of the first converted kings;
while Wessex remained true to its ancient paganism;
and Penda of Mercia, tolerant of Christianity
although himself no Christian, was dangerous
through his very indifference, his ambition, and the
triumphs of his arms over successive Northumbrian
princes. Still the great aim of Gregory was
not to be vain, and despite kings and peoples, nay
even despite the faintheartedness and “little faith”
of the missionaries, the work of conversion did go
on and prosper, until it embraced every portion of
the island, and every part of England made at least
an outward profession of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c001'>No sooner had the new creed found a reception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>among the Saxons than the establishment of
bishoprics followed in every separate kingdom. The
intention of Gregory had been to appoint two
metropolitans, each with twelve suffragan bishops,
one having his cathedral in London, the other in
York. But political events prevented the execution
of this plan: Canterbury retained the primacy
of the greater part of England, and (except during
a very few years) the rule over all the bishops on
this side the Humber; while York, after receiving
an archbishop in the person of Paulinus, remained
for nearly a century after his death under a bishop
only; and never succeeded in establishing more
than four suffragan sees, which were finally reduced
to two. This state of things naturally sprang from
the circumstances under which the conversion took
place. Had England been subject to one central
power, or had the relinquishment of paganism
taken place simultaneously in the several districts,
a general system might have been introduced
whose leading features might have been in accordance
with Gregory’s desire; but this was not the
case. The work of conversion was subject to many
difficulties which could not have been appreciated
at Rome. The pope had probably but sparing
knowledge of the relations which existed between
the Anglosaxon kingdoms, and how little concert
could be expected from their scattered and hostile
rulers. Nor could he have anticipated a jealous
and sullen resistance on the part of the Keltic
Christians, which was perhaps not altogether unprovoked
by the indiscreet pretensions of Augustine<a id='r851' /><a href='#f851' class='c012'><sup>[851]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>But the first bishops were in fact strictly
missionaries,—as much so as the bishop of New
Zealand among the Maori,—heads of various bodies
of voluntary adventurers, who at their own great
peril bore the tidings of salvation to the pagan
inhabitants of distant and separate localities. Prudence
indeed dictated the propriety of commencing
with those whose authority might tend to secure
their own safety, and whose example would be a
useful confirmation of their arguments; whose own
religious convictions also were less likely to be of
a settled and bigotted character than those of the
villagers in the Marks. Christianity, which in its
outset commenced with the lowest and poorest
classes of society, and slowly widened its circuit
till it embraced the highest, thus reversed the process
in England, and commenced with the courts
and households of the kings.</p>

<p class='c001'>Accordingly the conversion of a king was generally
followed by the establishment of a see, the
princes being apparently desirous of attaching a
Christian prelate to their comitatus, in place of the
Pagan high-priest who had probably occupied a
similar position. Considerations of personal dignity,
not less than policy, may have led to this result:
the lurking remains of heathen superstition may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>not have been without their weight: whatever were
the cause, we find at first a bishopric co-extensive
with a kingdom<a id='r852' /><a href='#f852' class='c012'><sup>[852]</sup></a>. But this was obviously an insufficient
provision in the larger districts, as Christianity
continued its triumphant course, and towards
the close of the seventh century, Theodore,
the first archbishop who succeeded in uniting all
the English church under his authority, finally accomplished
the division of the larger sees. From
this period till the ninth century, when the invasions
of the Northmen threw all the established
institutions into confusion, the English sees appear
to have ranked in the following order<a id='r853' /><a href='#f853' class='c012'><sup>[853]</sup></a>:—</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>Province of Canterbury.—1. Lichfield. 2. Leicester.
3. Lincoln. 4. Worcester. 5. Hereford.
6. Sherborne. 7. Winchester. 8. Elmham. 9.
Dummoc. 10. London. 11. Rochester. 12. Selsey.</p>

<p class='c001'>Province of York.—1. Hexham. 2. Lindisfarn.
3. Whiterne.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, inclusive of Canterbury and York, there
were seventeen sees. At a later period some of these
perished altogether, as Lindisfarn, Hexham, Whiterne
and Dummoc; while others were formed, as
Durham for Northumberland, Dorchester for Lincoln;
and in Wessex, Ramsbury (Hræfnesbyrig,
Ecclesia Corvinensis) for Wilts, Wells for Somerset,
Crediton for Devonshire, and during some time,
St. Petroc’s or Padstow for Cornwall.</p>

<p class='c001'>The earliest bishops among the Saxons were necessarily
strangers. Romans occupied the cathedral
thrones of Canterbury, Rochester and London,
and for a while that of York also. Northumberland
next passed for a short time under the direction
of Keltic prelates,—Scots as they were then called,—who
held no communion with the Romish missionaries.
Felix, a Burgundian, but not an Arian,
evangelized Eastanglia; Birinus, a Frank, carried
the faith to Wessex. But as these men gradually
left the scene of their labours, which must have
been much increased by the difficulty of teaching
populations who spoke a strange language, by
means of interpreters, their Saxon pupils addressed
themselves to the work with exemplary zeal and
earnestness; it was very soon found that the island
could supply itself with prelates fully equal to all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>the duties of their position; and to a mere accident
was the English church indebted at the end of the
seventh century for a foreign metropolitan, in the
person of Theodore of Tarsus. Although we may
reasonably suppose the traditions of the heathen
priesthood not to have been without some weight,
we must not conclude that these alone will account
for the number of noble Anglosaxons whom, from
the earliest period, we find devoting themselves to
the service of the church, and clothed with its
highest dignities. It must be admitted that nowhere
else did Christianity make a deeper or more lasting
impression than in England. Not only do we
see the high nobles and the near relatives of kings
among the bishops and archbishops, but kings
themselves—warlike and fortunate kings—suddenly
and voluntarily renouncing their temporal advantages,
retiring into monasteries, and abdicating
their crowns, that they may wander as pilgrims
to the shrines of the Apostles in Rome. We find
princesses and other high-born ladies devoting themselves
to a life of celibacy, or separating from their
husbands to preside over congregations of nuns: well
descended men cannot rest till they have wandered
forth to carry the tidings of redemption into distant
and barbarous lands; a life of abstinence and
hardship, to be crowned by a martyr’s death, seems
to have been hungered and thirsted after by the
wealthy and the noble,—assuredly an extraordinary
and an edifying spectacle among a race not at
all adverse to the pomps and pleasures of worldly
life, a spectacle which compels us to believe in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>the deep, earnest, conscientious spirit of self-sacrifice
and love of truth which characterized the
nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The complete organization of the ecclesiastical
power in England appears to have been effected by
Theodore, who is distinctly affirmed to have been
the first prelate whose authority the whole church
of the Angles consented to admit<a id='r854' /><a href='#f854' class='c012'><sup>[854]</sup></a>. There is reason
to suppose that this was not accomplished
without some difficulty, for it involved the division
of previously existing dioceses, and the consequent
diminution of previously existing power and influence.
Theodore, like Augustine, had been despatched
from Rome to England, under very peculiar circumstances.
After the death of Deusdedit, archbishop
of Canterbury, a difficulty appears to have
arisen about the election of a successor, in consequence
of which the see remained for some time
without an occupant<a id='r855' /><a href='#f855' class='c012'><sup>[855]</sup></a>. At length however Oswiú
of Northumberland and Ecgberht of Kent undertook
to put a period to a state of affairs which
must have caused grave inconveniences<a id='r856' /><a href='#f856' class='c012'><sup>[856]</sup></a>, and accordingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>they took, with the election and consent
of the church, a presbyter of the late archbishop,
named Wigheard, and sent him to Rome for consecration.
It is most remarkable that we hear
nothing of any co-operation on the part of Wessex
in this step, or of the powerful king of Mercia,
Wulfhere, who had succeeded in establishing the
independence of his country against all the efforts
of Oswiú himself. Shortly after his arrival
in Rome Wigheard died, and after some correspondence
with the English kings, Vitalian undertook
to provide a prelate for the vacant see<a id='r857' /><a href='#f857' class='c012'><sup>[857]</sup></a>. Various
difficulties being finally overcome, his choice fell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>upon Theodore of Tarsus, who accordingly was
despatched to England with the power of an archbishop,
and solemnly enthroned at Canterbury in
668.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hitherto there had been churches in England;
henceforward there was a church,—and a body of
clergy existing as a central institution, in spite of
the separation and frequent hostility of the states
to which the clergy themselves belonged. No doubt
the common rank and interests of the bishops, as
well as the necessity for canonical consecration had
from the first produced some sort of union among
them. But from the time of Theodore we find at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>least the southern prelates assembling in provincial
synods, under the direction of the metropolitan, to
declare the faith as it was found among them, establish
canons of discipline and rules of ecclesiastical
government, and generally to make such arrangements
as appeared likely to conduce to the well-being
of the church, without regard to the severance
of the kingdoms. To these synods, which though
not holden twice a year in accordance with Theodore’s
plan, and indeed with the ancient canons of
the church, were yet of frequent occurrence, the
bishops repaired, accompanied by some of their
co-presbyters and monks, and when the business
before them was completed, returned to promulgate
in their dioceses the regulations of the council,
and spread among their clergy the news of what
was doing in other lands for the furtherance of the
Gospel.</p>

<p class='c001'>The respectful deference paid to the Roman See
was thus naturally converted into a much closer
and more intimate relation. Saxon England was
essentially the child of Rome; whatever obligations
any of her kingdoms may have been under to the
Keltic missionaries,—and I cannot persuade myself
that these were at all considerable,—she certainly
had entirely lost sight of them at the close of the
seventh and the commencement of the eighth centuries.
Her national bishops, as the Kelts and disciples
of the Kelts have been unjustifiably called,
had either retired in disgust, like Colman, or been
deposed like Winfrið, or apostatized like Cedd.
It was to Rome that her nobles and prelates wandered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>as pilgrims; it was the interests of Rome
that her missionaries preached in Germany<a id='r858' /><a href='#f858' class='c012'><sup>[858]</sup></a> and
Friesland; it was to her that the archbishops elect
looked for their pall<a id='r859' /><a href='#f859' class='c012'><sup>[859]</sup></a>—the sign of their dignity:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>to the Pope her prelates appealed for redress, or
for authority: in the eighth century we find one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>pope sanctioning the formation of a third archiepiscopal
see, in defiance of the metropolitan of
Canterbury; and in the first year of the ninth century
we find this new arrangement abrogated by
the same authority. Lastly it was England that
gave to Rome Wilfrið and Willibrord and Adelberht,
Boniface and Willibald, Anselm and Becket
and Robert of Winchelsea.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although these facts will not suffice to establish
that sort of dependence <i>de iure</i>, which zealous Papal
partizans have asserted as the normal condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>of the English church, they do indisputably
prove that the example, advice and authority of
the See of Rome were very highly regarded among
our forefathers. It was impossible that it should
be otherwise; and there is not the slightest doubt
that—despite the Keltic clergy—the Anglosaxon
church looked with affection and respect to Rome
as the source of its own being. Respect and high
regard were paid to Rome in Gaul long before
Theodore; but not such submission as our countrymen,
less acquainted no doubt with their danger,
were zealous to pay. Indeed, when we consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>the position of the Roman See towards the North
of Europe, during the interval from the commencement
of the seventh till that of the ninth century,
we can scarcely escape from the conclusion that
England was the great basis of papal operations,
and the ποῦ στῶ from which Rome moved her world.
In the ninth century a continental author calls the
English “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maxime familiares apostolicae sedis</span><a id='r860' /><a href='#f860' class='c012'><sup>[860]</sup></a>,”
and in the tenth century it was unquestionably
England that made the greatest progress, even if
it did not take the initiative with regard to the
revival of monachism and the great question of
clerical celibacy. In short, throughout, the most
energetic and successful missionaries of Rome were
Englishmen.</p>

<p class='c001'>But England nevertheless retained in some sense
a national church. Many circumstances combined
to ensure a very considerable amount of independence
in this country. On the continent of Europe
the prelates and clergy whom the invasions of the
barbarians found established in the cities were, in
fact, Roman provincials; and this character continued
for a very long time to modify their relations
toward the conquerors: in Britain, either Christianity
was never widely and generally spread, or it
retreated before the steady advance of the pagan
Saxons. It is remarkable that we nowhere hear
of the existence of Christian churches before Augustine,
except in the territory exclusively British,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>and in the household of Æðelberht’s Frankish
queen, the latter an exception of little moment.</p>

<p class='c001'>But no sooner do the first missionary prelates
vanish from the scene, than we find them replaced
by Saxons belonging to the noblest and most powerful
families, and thus connecting the clergy with
the state by that most close and intimate tie which
forms the strongest and least objectionable security
for both. Berhtwald, the eighth archbishop of
Canterbury, was a very near relative of the Mercian
king Æðelred; Aldhelm was closely connected
with the royal family of Wessex; and even
down to the Conquest we find the scions of the
royal and noble houses occupying distinguished
stations in the ministry of the Church. It is obvious
how much this near and intimate association
with the national aristocracy must have tended to
diminish the evils of a separate institution, having
some kind of dependence upon a foreign centre;
and when to this it is added that the principal
clergy, as ministers of state and members of the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena gemót</span>, had a clear and distinct interest in
the maintenance of good government, and a personal
share in its administration, we can easily
understand why the clergy were, generally speaking,
kept better within bounds in England than in
other contemporaneous states<a id='r861' /><a href='#f861' class='c012'><sup>[861]</sup></a>. Guilty of extravagancies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>the clergy were here, no doubt, as elsewhere;
but on the whole their position was not
unfavourable to the harmonious working of the
state; and the history of the Anglosaxons is perhaps
as little deformed as any by the ambition and
power, and selfish class-interests of the clergy<a id='r862' /><a href='#f862' class='c012'><sup>[862]</sup></a>.
On the other hand it cannot be denied that in England,
as in other countries, the laity are under the
greatest obligations to them, partly for rescuing
some branches of learning from total neglect, and
partly for the counterpoise which their authority
presented to the rude and forcible government of
a military aristocracy. Ridiculous as it would be
to affirm that their influence was never exerted for
mischievous purposes, or that this institution was
always free from the imperfections and evils which
belong to all human institutions, it would be still
more unworthy of the dignity of history to affect
to undervalue the services which they rendered to
society. If in the pursuit of private and corporate
advantages they occasionally seemed likely to prefer
the separate to the general good, they did no
more than all bodies of men have done,—no more
than is necessary to ensure the active co-operation
of all bodies of men in any one line of conduct.
But, whatever their class-interests may from time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>to time have led them to do, let it be remembered
that they existed as a permanent mediating authority
between the rich and the poor, the strong
and the weak, and that, to their eternal honour,
they fully comprehended and performed the duties
of this most noble position. To none but themselves
would it have been permitted to stay the
strong hand of power, to mitigate the just severity
of the law, to hold out a glimmering of hope
to the serf, to find a place in this world and a
provision for the destitute, whose existence the
state did not even recognize. That the church of
Christ does not necessarily and indispensably imply
that form of ministration or constitution called
Episcopal, is certain; but on the other hand let
us not listen too readily to the doctrine which represents
episcopacy as inconsistent with Christianity.
To put it only on the lowest grounds, there
is great convenience in it; and though there are
no peculiar priests under the Christian dispensation,
it is very useful that there should be persons
specially appointed and educated to perform functions
necessary to the moral and religious training
of the people, and superior officers charged with
the inspection over those persons. It would be
difficult for the State to ascertain the condition of
its members, as regards the most important of all
considerations,—their moral capability of obedience
to the law,—without such a body of recognized
ministers and recognized inspectors. Accordingly
the Anglosaxon State at once recognized the
Bishops as State officers.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>The circumstances under which the establishment
of Christianity took place naturally threw a
great power of superintendence and interference
into the hands of the kings: from the beginning
we find them taking a very active part both in the
formation of sees, the appointment of bishops, and
other public measures touching the government of
the church and—within this—the relation of the
clergy to the state. The privileges and rights
conceded to the clerical body were granted by the
king and his witan, and enjoyed under their guarantee;
and down to the last moment of the Anglosaxon
monarchy we find the episcopal elections
or appointments to have been controlled by them.
Indeed as the clergy, the people and the state may
be said to have been duly represented by the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena
gemót</span>, an episcopal election made by them appears
to possess in all respects the genuine character of
a canonical election: and in times when there were
no parliamentary struggles to make single votes
valuable, there seems no reason whatever to question
that this mode was found satisfactory. The
loose manner in which the early writers mention
the appointment of the bishops, hardly permits us
to draw any very definite conclusions; yet it would
seem natural that, where the whole missionary work
depended upon the goodwill of the king, the latter,
with or without his council, would exercise a paramount
authority in all matters of detail. Accordingly,
though we do meet with instances in which
the free election of prelates may be assumed, we
do far more frequently find them both appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>and displaced by the mere act of the royal will<a id='r863' /><a href='#f863' class='c012'><sup>[863]</sup></a>.
The case of Wessex in the seventh century is instructive.
Ægilberht, a Frank, had succeeded Birinus,
the first missionary bishop; but, from some
cause or other, he lost the favour of the king<a id='r864' /><a href='#f864' class='c012'><sup>[864]</sup></a>, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>proposed to divide his diocese, which was too large
in fact for one prelate, and to appoint Wini, a native
Westsaxon, to the second see. Ægilberht then
withdrew from England in disgust, and the king
committed the undivided bishopric to Wini: but
on some subsequent misunderstanding, this bishop
was expelled from Wessex, and afterwards <em>purchased</em>
the see of London from Wulfhari, king of
the Mercians. Coinwalh then applied for and obtained
another bishop from Gaul in the person of
Liuthari or Lothaire, Ægilberht’s nephew. Equally
great irregularities seem to have been admitted in
respect to the Northumbrian sees in the time of
Wilfrið; and indeed throughout the Anglosaxon
history it appears that the ruling powers, that is
the king and the witan, did in fact succeed in retaining
the nomination of the bishops in their
own hands<a id='r865' /><a href='#f865' class='c012'><sup>[865]</sup></a>. I have already mentioned instances of
episcopal nominations by the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena gemót</span><a id='r866' /><a href='#f866' class='c012'><sup>[866]</sup></a>, and
called attention to the significant fact of so many
royal chaplains promoted to sees<a id='r867' /><a href='#f867' class='c012'><sup>[867]</sup></a>. It is difficult
no doubt to withstand a royal recommendation, and
though in the case of the Anglosaxon prelates this
does not always seem to have ensured the canonical
virtues, it perhaps very sufficiently supplied their
want. After the appointment or election had thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>been made, it was usual for the bishop elect to make
his profession of faith to his metropolitan; then to
receive episcopal consecration from him, assisted
by such of his suffragans as he thought fit. He
then most likely received seizin of the temporalities
in the usual way by royal writ. The following is
the instrument issued in 1060, for the temporalities
of the see of Hereford, on the appointment of Walther,
queen Eádgyfu’s Lorraine chaplain. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eadwardus

<p class='c001'>The metropolitans themselves were to receive
consecration from one another, in order that the
expense and trouble of going to Rome might be
avoided: but during the abeyance of the archiepiscopate
of York, the prelate elect of Canterbury
appears to have been sometimes consecrated in
Gaul, sometimes by a conclave of suffragan bishops
at home: thus in 731 Tátwine was consecrated at
Canterbury by Daniel, Ingwald, Aldwine and Aldwulf,
the respective bishops of Winchester, London,
Worcester and Rochester<a id='r872' /><a href='#f872' class='c012'><sup>[872]</sup></a>; and Pope Gregory
the Third either made or acknowledged this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>consecration to be valid by the transmission of a
pall in 733. We have no evidence by whom the
consecrations were performed, in many cases, but
it is probable that the old rule was adhered to as
much as possible. In 1020, Æðelnóð was consecrated
to Canterbury by archbishop Wulfstán: the
ceremony took place at Canterbury on the 13th of
November<a id='r873' /><a href='#f873' class='c012'><sup>[873]</sup></a> in that year: and since in many cases
the ordination of archbishops is mentioned without
any details, but yet as preliminary to their going
to Rome for their palls, it is likely that the chroniclers
tacitly assumed the custom of reciprocal
functions in Canterbury and York to be too well
known to require description.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the nomination or election by the king
and his witan had taken place, it is probable that
a royal mandate was sent to the metropolitan, to
perform the ceremony of consecration. We have
yet the instrument by which Wulfstán of York
certifies to Cnut the performance of this duty in
the case of archbishop Æðelnóð<a id='r874' /><a href='#f874' class='c012'><sup>[874]</sup></a>: the archbishop
says:—“Wulfstán the archbishop greets Cnut his
lord, and Ælfgyfu the lady, humbly: and I notify
to you both, dear ones, that we have done as notice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>came from you to us respecting bishop Æðelwold,
namely that we have now consecrated him.” He
then prays that the new prelate may have all the
rights and dues granted to him, which have been
usual, and enjoyed by his predecessors: which
perhaps is to be understood as a formal demand
that the temporalities may be properly conferred
upon him. There can be no manner of doubt as
to the meaning of the word <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>swutelung</i></span>, which I have
rendered by <em>notice</em>, and Lingard by <em>order</em><a id='r875' /><a href='#f875' class='c012'><sup>[875]</sup></a>: it is a
legal notification, and the technical word in a writ
is <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>swutelian</i></span>. But I do not believe that Cnut was
any more imperative in this matter than his predecessors
had been. An Anglosaxon archbishop
would never have found it a very safe thing to
neglect a royal command by ancient right<a id='r876' /><a href='#f876' class='c012'><sup>[876]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bishops were in fact officers of the administration,
and whatever importance their ecclesiastical
functions may have possessed, their civil character
was not of less moment. It is abundantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>obvious that men of such a class, possessing nearly
a monopoly of what learning existed, would be
necessarily called to assist in the national councils,
and would be very generally employed in the
diplomatic intercourse with foreign countries: few
persons of equal rank would have been competent
to conduct a negotiation carried on in writing:
and there is no doubt that their high position in
the universal institution of the church rendered
them at that period the fittest persons to manage
those affairs which concerned the general family of
nations. Moreover a close alliance always existed
in England between the aristocracy and the clergy:
faithful service of the altar, like faithful service of
the state, gave rank and dignity and privileges;
and the ecclesiastical authority and influence of
the bishop, as well as his habits of business, and
general aptitude to advance the interests of the
crown, frequently designated him to discharge the
somewhat indefinite, but weighty, duties of what
we now call a prime minister. Administration is
in truth of such far greater importance than constitution,
that we can readily see how greatly the
social welfare of England did in reality depend upon
this class, to whom so much of administrative detail
was committed: and it was truly fortunate for
the country that the clerical profession was one
that a gentleman could devote himself to without
disparagement, and therefore embraced so many
distinguished members of the ruling class.</p>

<p class='c001'>The civil and ecclesiastical jurisdictions were, it
is well known, not separated in England until after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>the Conquest. William the Norman was the first
to establish that most questionable division, the consequences
of which were often so bitterly felt by his
successors. Previous to his reign the bishop had been
the assessor of the ealdorman in the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírgemót</span> or
county-court, and ecclesiastical causes, except such
as were reserved for the decision of the episcopal
synods, were subjected, like those of the laity, to the
judgment of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scírþegnas</span> or shire-thanes: thus
even probate of wills was given in the county-court.
This participation of bishops in the administration
of justice, useful and necessary in the early ages of
Christianity, was very probably derived from the
functions of their heathen predecessors, the priests
of the ancient gods. The old Germanic <em>placita</em>
were held, as is well known, under the presidency
of the priests, and these were courts of law as well
as courts of parliament. In fact there is no reason
whatever to doubt that, long before the introduction
of Christianity, the public pleadings were
opened with religious ceremonies, and that the
course of procedure was regulated by religious
ideas<a id='r877' /><a href='#f877' class='c012'><sup>[877]</sup></a>. The gods were present,—to secure the
peaceful administration of justice, to sanction the
finding of the freemen, to give a holy character to
the act of <em>doing right</em> between man and man,—to
terrify the perjurer and the criminal,—perhaps to
justify the extreme penalty of the law in extreme
cases; for it is probable that to the gods alone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>could the life of a great wrongdoer be offered, as an
atonement to the Law, of which God is the root and
guardian. The institution of the ordeal by which
it was superstitiously supposed that the Almighty
would reveal the hidden truth or falsehood of men,
further tended to connect, first the pagan and afterwards
the Christian priesthood with the administration
of justice. In that most solemn appeal to the
omniscience and justice of God, the clergy necessarily
took the prominent part; and although we
cannot believe that they always resisted the temptation
offered by that most strange juggle, it may
charitably be asserted that their intervention not
rarely saved the innocent from the penal consequences
of an uncertain and painful test.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have remarked in an earlier chapter<a id='r878' /><a href='#f878' class='c012'><sup>[878]</sup></a> upon the
union of the sacerdotal with the judicial power: at
a very early stage of human society, the functions
of the priest and the judge seem in general to have
been inseparable; nor were they separated in fact
upon the introduction of Christianity. In the very
commencement of our æra, when the church really
did exist as a brotherhood under the guidance of the
first disciples, it was most natural that all contentions
between members of the body should be settled
by the arbitration of the whole church, or such
as represented it. Litigation before the ordinary
tribunals of the state, even could such have been
resorted to by Christians, was little consonant with
the doctrine of charity which was to prevail among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>the members of one mystical body, founded on almighty
Love. Accordingly St. Paul himself<a id='r879' /><a href='#f879' class='c012'><sup>[879]</sup></a> expressly
forbids the disciples to carry their contentions
before the secular authorities, implying that
it is their duty to bring them to the consideration
of their fellow-believers, that they may be amicably
settled, in the spirit of forbearance and Christian
moderation. And as persecution gradually threatened
the terrified community, this course became
unavoidable: it was impossible for the Christian to
submit to the pagan forms of the tribunals, yet to
refuse these was to proclaim the adoption of a proscribed
and illegal association. The establishment
of a hierarchy among the Christians themselves
supplied some remedy for this difficulty, and it was
soon decided that the disputes of the brotherhood
were to be brought before the presbyter or bishop
as a judge,—a course which in itself was natural in
countries where the Romans had permitted the existence
of some authority in the national tribunals,
and had not insisted upon dragging every cause
before their own officers. The peculiar situation
of the Christians themselves as citizens of a new
state—viz. the religious state—tended to consolidate
this system. Christianity took cognizance of
motives, of acts entirely beyond the reach of mere
human law, and the community claimed a right to
judge of the internal as well as the external state of its
members. Immorality, not cognizable by any positive
law, was a proper subject for the animadversion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>of a body whose duty it was to exclude from communion
all who pertinaciously refused to perform the
duties of their profession. It was thus that a twofold
jurisdiction became lodged in the church,—and
in the bishop or presbyter, as its representative in
each particular locality,—long before the reception
of Christianity among the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>religiones licitae</i></span> transformed
the customs of an obscure sect into recognised
laws of the empire. But no sooner had the
terms of the great alliance been arranged, than the
state hastened to give the imperial sanction to what
had hitherto been merely the bye-laws of a sodality:
and the decisions of a council, if confirmed by the
assent of the emperor, were at once raised to the rank
of imperial laws. Thus the council of Carthage in 397
had threatened with excommunication any clergyman
who should pursue another before the secular
tribunals; and this decree, repeated in 451 by the
fourth general Council—that of Chalcedon—had received
the sanction of Marcianus, and become part
of the law of the Roman empire. The jurisdiction of
the bishops in the affairs of the clergy was thus rendered
legal; but it was at a later period extended so
as to include a much wider sphere. Justinian not
only commanded all causes in which monks were
concerned to be referred to the bishop of the diocese,
but made him the only legal channel of proceedings
even in cases where laymen had claims
against the clergy<a id='r880' /><a href='#f880' class='c012'><sup>[880]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Arbitration by the bishop had thus grown up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>into a custom, at first absolutely necessary, and
afterwards always desirable, in a society like the
Christian. Accordingly Constantine permitted all
contentions to be so settled. But it was a rule of
Roman law that there could lie no appeal whatever
from a voluntary arbitration; and in pursuance
of this rule, in the year 408, Arcadius and
Honorius decreed that the sentences of bishops
should be without appeal<a id='r881' /><a href='#f881' class='c012'><sup>[881]</sup></a>. In this manner was
the ecclesiastical jurisdiction founded in the Greek
and Roman empires.</p>

<p class='c001'>Happily for ourselves, this could not be admitted
without modification in the Germanic states. Had
it indeed been so, every trace of independence
would long since have perished, and the whole
civilized world have found itself subject to the
principles and regulations of an effete scheme of
jurisprudence. The antagonism of the Germanic
customary right it was that saved us from the
consequences which must have followed the universal
prevalence of maxims elaborated by another
race, and sprung out of a different social condition.
It was the conflict of the Roman and Ecclesiastical
laws with those of the Teutonic victors that produced
that modified system of relations, under
which, by the blessing of Providence, civilization has
been maintained, the general well-being of mankind
advanced, and human society firmly established
throughout Europe, on a basis susceptible
of progressive, perhaps illimitable improvement.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>Useful as a counter-check to the somewhat disruptive
system of the Germans, the Roman and
Ecclesiastical laws have yet never been able to destroy
the nationality, or abridge the freedom, of our
races; while they have tended to give consistency
and method to our own customs, and to reduce into
form and harmony what, but for them, might have
been liable to fall asunder from its own internal
vigour. Like the centripetal and centrifugal forces,
they have balanced one another, and held our
social state together as one majestic and consistent
whole.</p>

<p class='c001'>The method of doing justice between man and
man, which was the very foundation-stone of the
Teutonic polity, was in direct opposition to the
doctrines of Roman jurists and the practice of the
church. Justice went out from among the people
themselves, not from the king or the bishop. The
people spoke both as to fact and law, the ancient
customary law; nor did they at any time allow
their relations as Christians to abrogate the older
rights they had possessed as citizens, where the
exercise of these was clearly compatible with the
recognition of the former. In respect to their religion,
they duly submitted to the ecclesiastical
authority, made confession, performed penance, and
hearkened to advice tendered by qualified functionaries;
but they nevertheless still met in their
folk- and shire-moots to hold plea, declare folk-right,
and superintend its execution by their national
officers. Not even to the clergy themselves did
they accord an immunity from the universal duties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>of freemen: and although they may have been disposed
to acquiesce in the claim to be quit of personal
military service, they never excused suit and
service to the popular courts. Only when the relation
of a cleric to his superior was that of an
unfree man to his lord, did the state release him
from this duty, or rather did the state hold him
unworthy of this privilege.</p>

<p class='c001'>The existence of such a body as the English
clergy could not possibly be ignored. As organized
agents of a system which professed to exercise
a right of rule over the most secret desires and
motives of men,—as students distinguished by their
knowledge, or remarkable for their piety,—as landlords,
in the enjoyment of great wealth, and chiefs
of numerous dependents,—lastly as advisers and
ministers of the ruling class, or intermediaries in
the intercourse with foreign states,—they formed
a power whose claims to attention could not be
neglected. But their social position itself was that
which brought them continually in relation with
the other aggregates of freemen, and they were
therefore called upon to take their place with other
landowners, lords, or ministerials in the popular
councils.</p>

<p class='c001'>With all their attachment to the customary law
and the national franchises, the Anglosaxons never
lost sight of the fact that Christianity had introduced
new social relations: they were ready to
admit that there was now a godcund or <em>divine</em> as
well as woroldcund or <em>secular</em> right; and in the exposition
of the former they were willing to follow the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>guidance of those who professed to make it their
especial study. Moreover the system of Anglosaxon
jurisprudence depended very much upon the
trustworthy character of witnesses, and the ordination
of the clergy was justly taken to have
imposed upon them the obligation of a peculiar
truthfulness. The testimony of members of their
class became therefore a very important thing in
the sight of the <em>moot-thanes</em> who might have disputed
points to settle, or who, in mixed causes,
might shrink from doing wrong to the venerable
body by too strict an application of the principles
by which themselves were bound. Lastly, as there
was a merciful tendency among the people to have
disputes settled by arbitration and on equitable
grounds, rather than by the strict rules of law, the
clergy, whose jurisdiction extended to the motives
of Christians rather than the mere acts of citizens,
were valuable intermediaries between contending
parties. The dignity of the class—the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>honor clericalis</i></span>—was
cheerfully recognised, the wisdom and
goodness of the body acknowledged, and the propriety
of being to a great degree guided by the
experience and enlightenment of their leaders,
readily conceded. Accordingly the bishop became
an inseparable assessor of the Frankish count and
of the Anglosaxon ealdorman in their respective
courts<a id='r882' /><a href='#f882' class='c012'><sup>[882]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The duties of a bishop as the officer of a state,
and contradistinguished from his merely ecclesiastical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>functions, were to assist in the administration
of justice between man and man, to guard against
perjury, and to superintend the administration of
the ordeals; further to take care that no fraud was
committed by means of unjust measures, to which
end he was made the guardian of the standards,
and the judge of what work might be demanded
from the serf; above all, to watch over the maintenance
of the peace, and the upholding of divine
as well as secular law<a id='r883' /><a href='#f883' class='c012'><sup>[883]</sup></a>. The canons of the church
did indeed prohibit the presence of bishops on trials
which might involve the penalties of death or mutilation;
and even the Constitutions of Clarendon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>the object of which was to place the clergy on their
proper and ancient footing towards the other members
of the church and state, recognised this exemption<a id='r884' /><a href='#f884' class='c012'><sup>[884]</sup></a>:
but there is little reason to suppose that it was
regarded by the Anglosaxons; indeed the popular
courts had no power to pass sentences of so deep
a dye, until long after the custom of the bishop’s
presence therein had been established too firmly to
be questioned. It was otherwise among the Franks,
and we may perhaps attribute this to the strong
nationality of the Frankish clergy, which indisposed
them to claim their canonical immunity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another exemption which the bishops properly
possessed, seems also to have been often neglected
in this country,—that namely of personal service
in the field. No doubt, all over Europe, as soon as
the bishops became possessed of lands liable to the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>hereban</i></span>, or military muster, they, like other lords,
were compelled to place their armed tenants on
foot, for the public service, when duly required:
but their levies were mostly commanded by officers
specially designated for that purpose and known
under the names of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>advocati</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vicedomini</i></span>, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vidames</i></span>;
being in general nobles of power and dignity who
assumed or accepted the exercise of the bishop’s
royalties, the management of his estates, the administration
and execution of his justice, and a remunerative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>share of his revenues and patronage. In
Saxon England, however, we do not meet with
these officers; and though it is probable that the
bishop’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> was bound to lead his contingent
under the command of the ealdorman, yet we have
ample evidence that the prelates themselves did not
hold their station to excuse them from taking part
in the just and lawful defence of their country and
religion against strange and pagan invaders<a id='r885' /><a href='#f885' class='c012'><sup>[885]</sup></a>. Too
many fell in conflict to allow of our attributing
their presence on the field merely to their anxiety
lest the belligerents should be without the due
consolations of religion; and in other cases, upon
the alarm of hostile incursions, we find the levies
stated to have been led against the enemy by the
duke and bishop of the district.</p>

<p class='c001'>Attention has been called in another chapter to
the fact that the bishops did not universally (or
indeed usually), make their residences in the principal
cities<a id='r886' /><a href='#f886' class='c012'><sup>[886]</sup></a>. A remarkable distinction thus arose
between themselves and the prelates of Gaul and
Germany. The latter, strong in the support of the
burgesses, and identified with the urban interests,
found means to consolidate a power which they
used without scruple against the king when it suited
their convenience, or which enabled them to extort
from him the grant of offices that virtually
rendered them independent of his authority. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>was generally effected through the bishop’s obtaining
the county, that is becoming the count, and
thus exercising the palatine power in his city, as
well as that which he might already possess <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>iure
episcopii</i></span>, and as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>defensor urbis</i></span> or patron of the
municipality. This, rare indeed under Charlemagne,
but not uncommon in the times which preceded
and followed him, can at least not be proved to
have taken place in England before the Conquest<a id='r887' /><a href='#f887' class='c012'><sup>[887]</sup></a>.
There is indeed one instance which might seem at
first sight to contradict this assertion, but which
upon closer investigation rather confirms it. We
learn that certain thieves, having attempted a sacrilegious
entry into the church of St. Eádmund,
and being miraculously delivered into the hands of
the authorities, were put to death by the orders of
Ðeódred, then bishop of London and of Eastanglia<a id='r888' /><a href='#f888' class='c012'><sup>[888]</sup></a>.
This event took place after the conquest of the last-named
province by Æðelstán, who about 930 drove
the Danes from it or reduced them under his own
power. At that time it appears uncertain whether
the conquered kingdom had been duly arranged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>and settled, or whether any ealdorman had been
appointed to govern it. If not, we must imagine
that Ðeódred, the only constituted authority on the
spot, acted at his own discretion in a case of urgency,
without absolutely possessing the legal power
to do so; that the act was in short one of those
examples of what in modern times we understand
by the term Lynch-law, that law which men are
obliged to administer for themselves in the absence
of the regular machinery of government. But it is
further observable that, according to the terms of
the legend itself, these thieves were taken <em>in the
manner</em>, and consequently liable to capital punishment
without any trial at all<a id='r889' /><a href='#f889' class='c012'><sup>[889]</sup></a>; this justice we may
suppose Ðeódred to have executed, and to its summary
character we may attribute the regrets he
expressed on the subject at a later time. It is also
possible to account for the act by supposing that
even at this early period the bishop possessed his
sacu and sócn in the demesne of St. Eádmund, and
that he proceeded to execute his thieves by his
right as lord of the sócn: but there is no clear
proof that the immunity did exist before the time
of Cnut, and I therefore incline to the second explanation
as the most probable. But if Ðeódred
did not act in pursuance of possessing the comitial
power, we may safely say that there is no evidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>whatever of any Saxon bishop having exercised it<a id='r890' /><a href='#f890' class='c012'><sup>[890]</sup></a>.
As assessor to the ealdorman, the bishop was especially
charged to attend to the due levy of tithe
and other church imposts; but this was clearly because
he had a direct interest in the law that decreed
their punctual payment, and was certain not
to connive at any neglect in its execution, which
the ealdorman out of favour or carelessness might
possibly have been disposed to do.</p>

<p class='c001'>But a still higher authority was placed in the
hands of the bishop, derived in fact from the assumed
pre-eminence of the ecclesiastical over the
secular power. If the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> would not do justice,
and maintain the peace in the land, then the bishop
was especially commanded to enforce the fines
which the king and his witan had apportioned to
that officer’s offence<a id='r891' /><a href='#f891' class='c012'><sup>[891]</sup></a>. It was no doubt argued that
no <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> would be found bold enough to incur the
danger of offering violent resistance to the sacred
person of the prelate; and even the ealdorman, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>might have set the king at defiance, would tremble
to encounter the substantial terrors of excommunication
and a laborious penance.</p>

<p class='c001'>The high station occupied by the bishop in the
social hierarchy is proved by the amount of his
wergyld and of the fines assigned to offences against
his honour, his person, and his property. Although
the bishop and the presbyter are in fact but of one
order in the church, yet the state found it convenient
to place the former on much the higher
scale. In the “North-people’s law” an archbishop
is reckoned upon the same footing as an æðeling
or prince of the blood, at fifteen thousand thrymsas,
and a bishop upon the same footing as an ealdorman
at eight thousand. The breach of a bishop’s
surety or protection, like the ealdorman’s, rendered
the offender liable to a fine of two pounds, which
in the case of an archbishop rose to three<a id='r892' /><a href='#f892' class='c012'><sup>[892]</sup></a>. He
that drew weapon before a bishop or ealdorman
was to be mulcted in one hundred shillings, before
an archbishop, in one hundred and fifty<a id='r893' /><a href='#f893' class='c012'><sup>[893]</sup></a>. Under Ini
the violence done to a bishop’s dwelling, and the
seat of his jurisdiction, was to be compensated with
one hundred and twenty shillings, while the ealdorman’s
was protected by a fine of only eighty: in
this the episcopal dignity was placed upon a level
with that of the king himself<a id='r894' /><a href='#f894' class='c012'><sup>[894]</sup></a>. Similarly Wihtrǽd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>had declared his mere word, without an oath, to
be like the king’s, incontrovertible.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ecclesiastical functions of the bishops were
here the same as elsewhere. To them belonged the
ordination of priests and deacons, the hallowing
of chrism, the ceremonies of confirmation, the consecration
of churches and churchyards, nuns and
monks; they had a right to regulate the lives and
conversation of their clergy, to superintend the
monastic foundations, and in general to watch that
every detail of the ecclesiastical establishment was
duly regarded and maintained. In their peculiar
synods they could frame canons of discipline, to be
enforced in the several dioceses. They were the
receivers-general of all ecclesiastical revenue, which
they distributed to the inferior clergy under their
government, according to certain specified regulations;
providing out of the common fund for the
due maintenance of the priests, the buildings, and
minor accessories required for decent celebration of
the rites of religion.<a id='r895' /><a href='#f895' class='c012'><sup>[895]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But the most important of their functions was
that which is technically called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>iurisdictio fori interni</i></span>,
their jurisdiction in matters of conscience,
their dealing with the motives and feelings, rather
than the acts of men. This—which practically
they exercised through the several presbyters who
were, for the general convenience, dispersed over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>the face of the country,—was the true source of
their power, and measure of their social influence.
Positive law deals only with the actions of men,
and then only when they are perfected or completed:
religion regulates the inward impulses from
which those actions spring, and its authority extends
both before and beyond them: intention, not
act, is its proper province. But the secret intentions
and motives of men are known perfectly to
God alone; the man himself may, and often does
possess but an indistinct and fallacious notion of
his own impulses; and as it is in these, rather than
in the acts which are their results, that the essence
of guilt lies, the Christian was taught to unbosom
himself to one of more experienced and disciplined
feelings;—one whose profession was to console
the distracted sinner, and who, on genuine repentance,
was empowered to announce the glad tidings
of reconciliation with God. Confession of sins was
the mode pointed out by the founder of the church,
to obtain the blessings of almighty mercy; but how
were the ignorant, the obstinate, or the despairing
to know the right manner of such confession?
How could they know in what form confession was
effectually to be made to God? How could they,
plunged in sin and foulness, dare to approach the
source of all purity and holiness? What hope
could the grovelling outcast have of being admitted
to the throne of his glorious King, even for
the purpose of renouncing his state of rebellion
and apostasy? But the glorious King was a merciful
sovereign, who had commissioned certain of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>servants, reconciled sinners themselves, to be intermediaries
between his own majesty and the terror-stricken
offender: they had been sent forth armed
with full power to receive the submission which
the guilty feared to offer to Himself in person, furnished
with instructions as to the exact mode in
which the satisfactory propitiation was to be made.
These commissioners were the especial body of the
clergy,—the successors and representatives of the
Levitical Priests under the Law,—the offerers of the
sacrifices,—to whom the spirit of God had been
exclusively communicated in the ceremony of their
ordination, and who thereby became possessors of
the divine authority, to bind and loose, to forgive
sins on earth and in the world to come. The
clergy therefore undertook to direct the suffering
and heart-broken outlaw to the throne of peace.
Again, as the merely human preacher of atonement
possessed of himself no means of ascertaining
the genuineness of repentance, a system of
penances was established which might serve as a
test of the penitent’s earnestness: and too soon a
miserable error grew up that, by submitting to self-inflicted
punishments, the sinner might diminish
the weight of the penalties which he had earned in
a future state. But he might exceed or fall short
of the just measure, if not duly weighed and apportioned
by those who were in possession of the divine
will in that respect: men had even without
their own knowledge become holy and justified by
their works of self-abasement and humiliation and
charity: such men might exceed the necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>limit of penance and mortification:—happily for
the sinner and the saint, the priest had a code of
instructions at hand by which the difficulties in all
cases could be readily adjusted.</p>

<p class='c001'>These codes of instructions, known by the names
of Confessionalia, Poenitentialia, Modus imponendi
Poenitentiam, and the like, were compiled by the
bishops, to whom the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>iurisdictio fori interni</i></span> was
exclusively competent, as soon as the episcopal
system became firmly settled. The presbyter exercised
it only as the bishop’s vicar, when it became
inconvenient for the penitent to visit a distant
cathedral or metropolis. The episcopal right was
open to every bishop: each one might, if he dared,
embody his own ideas on the subject in a code,
which would derive its authority from conformity
to the recognised customs of the church, the personal
reputation of its author, and the general acceptance
by his episcopal peers throughout the
world. The differing circumstances of differing
states of society required skilful adaptation of general
rules; and therefore any bishop who felt in his
conscience that he was qualified for the task, might
bring the light of his wisdom to the consideration
of this weighty matter, and make such regulations
as to himself seemed good, for the management of
his own diocese,—certain that, if the blessing of
God rested upon his endeavours, his views would
be widely circulated and adopted by his neighbours.
There is perhaps no more melancholy evidence in
existence of the vanity and worthlessness of human
endeavours than the celebrated works which thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>arose in various parts of Europe; and nothing can
demonstrate more strikingly the folly and wickedness
of squaring and shaping the unlimited mercy
of God by the rule and measure of mere human
intelligence. With the contents of these Poenitentials
we have of course not here to deal; but I am
bound to say that I know of no more fatal sources
of antichristian error, no more miserable records
of the debasement and degradation of human intellect,
no more frightful proofs of the absence of genuine
religion. It was the evil tendency of those
barbarous early ages not to be satisfied with the
simple promises of divine mercy, and faith was
clouded and confused by the crowd of incongruous
images which were raised between itself and its all-glorious
object. At one time terrified by the consciousness
of sin, at another deluded by the cheap
hope of ceremonial justification, the human race
eagerly rushed to multiply the means of salvation,
and franticly rejoiced in the establishment of a host
of mediators between themselves and their crucified
Redeemer, between the frightened but unconverted
sinner, and his offended Lord and Maker.
The pure Word of God was not then, as it now is,
accessible to every reader; and those whose duty
it was to proclaim what the mass of men could not
obtain access to themselves, had erred into a devious
labyrinth of traditions, through which the
weary wayfarer circled and circled in endless, objectless
gyrations, at every turn more distant only
from the goal he pursued. Pure and good were
no doubt the objects sought by Cummian, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>Theodore and Ælfríc, and pious the spirit in which
they wrought; but the foundation of their house
was upon sand, and when the rains fell and the
tempests roared around it vanished in a moment
from before the sight of God and man, never to be
reconstructed, even until the closing of the ages.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sources of revenue by which the bishops
supported their temporal power will be considered
in a subsequent chapter: it is enough that we find
them to have been amply endowed with fitting
means, in every part of Europe. During the Anglosaxon
period, poverty and self-denial were not
the characteristics of the class, however they may
have distinguished certain members of the body.
Nor will the philosophical enquirer see cause for
regret in this: far more will he rejoice in the establishment
of any system which tends to draw closer
the bonds of intercourse between the clerical and
lay members of the church, which leads to the
identification of their worldly as well as their eternal
interests, and unites them in one harmonious
work of praise and thanksgiving, one active service
of worship and charity and love, before the face of
Him in whom they are united as one holy priesthood.
It is the separation of the clergy from the
laity, as a class, to which the world owes so many
ages of misery and error; and to the comparative
union of both orders in the church, we may perhaps
attribute the general quiet which, in these
respects, characterized the Anglosaxon polity. On
these points of separation I shall also have something
to say hereafter; but for the present one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>more subject alone remains to be treated of in this
chapter, the last but not least remarkable function
of the episcopal authority and power. By far the
most important point of the public ecclesiastical
jurisdiction,—for the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>iurisdictio fori interni</i></span> is quite
another thing,—lay in the questions of marriage,
which were especially reserved for the bishop’s
cognizance. The prohibitions which the clergy
enforced were obviously unknown to the strict
Teutonic law, which permitted considerable licence
in these respects. From Tacitus we learn that a
sort of polygamy was not unknown on the part of
the princes; it was probably looked upon as a useful
mode of increasing the alliances of the tribe<a id='r896' /><a href='#f896' class='c012'><sup>[896]</sup></a>,—the
only conceivable ground on which it could have
been allowed by a race so strict in the observance
of marriage. We do not know within what degrees
the Germans permitted unions which the Roman
clergy considered incestuous, but we do know that
Gregory considered a relaxation of the strict rule
necessary to the success of Augustine in Britain;
that he gave the missionary positive instructions
upon the subject, and, when blamed by his episcopal
brother of Messina for this concession, justified
his course by the danger which he apprehended for
his plan of conversion, if the prejudices of the Saxons
on so vital a point were too hastily shocked<a id='r897' /><a href='#f897' class='c012'><sup>[897]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>From these directions of Gregory we learn not only
that the marriage of first cousins was common, but—what
is much more surprising—that the marriage
with a father’s widow was so likewise. Nor can
we doubt this, when we not only find recorded
cases of its occurrence, but when we have a Teutonic
king distinctly affirming it to be the legal
custom of his people: in the sixth century Ermengisl
king of the Varni can say, “Let Radiger
my son marry his step-mother, even as our national
custom permits<a id='r898' /><a href='#f898' class='c012'><sup>[898]</sup></a>;” and therefore when we find
Beda speaking of a similar marriage, and declaring
Eádbald to have been “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fornicatione pollutus tali
qualem nec inter gentes auditam Apostolus testatur,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>ita ut uxorem patris haberet</span><a id='r899' /><a href='#f899' class='c012'><sup>[899]</sup></a>,” or Asser on another
such occasion saying that it was “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">contra Dei interdictum,
et Christianorum dignitatem, nec non et
contra omnium Paganorum consuetudinem,</span>” we
can only suppose that they either did not know, or
that they deemed it advisable not to recognise, the
ancient heathen practice.</p>

<p class='c001'>In both the cases referred to, the obvious scandal
was put a stop to by the separation of the parties<a id='r900' /><a href='#f900' class='c012'><sup>[900]</sup></a>,—Eádbald
being evidently led to this step by superstitious
fears, rather than submitting to an episcopal
authority exercised by Laurentius. It is certainly
strange in the case of Æðelbald, if there
really were a separation, that we hear nothing of
the interference of the Church to produce so important
an event.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>We learn that by degrees the time arrived at
which the clergy thought themselves strong enough
to insist upon a stricter observance of the canonical
prohibitions, and various instances are on record
where their intervention is mentioned, to separate
persons too nearly connected by blood. It is probable
that many more of these are intended than
we actually know; for unhappily the monkish
writers are over-fond of using strong expressions
both of praise and blame, and not rarely fling <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pellex
scortum</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>concubina</i></span> at the heads of women who
were for all that, legally speaking, very honest
wives. One celebrated case has obtained a worldwide
reputation,—that of Eádwig, the details of
whose unhappy fate will probably for ever remain
a mystery. Political calculations, and unreconciled
national jealousies were in all probability the mainsprings
of the events of his troublous life; but
that which lends it all its romance—his separation
from Ælfgyfu—was the act of a prelate determined
upon upholding the ecclesiastical law of marriage.
It is to be regretted that we do not know the exact
degree of relationship between the royal victims.
It may have been too close, in the eyes of the
stricter clergy; yet we cannot close our eyes to the
fact that it was long acquiesced in by the English
nobles; nor, had Eádwig shown himself more pliant
to the pretensions of Dúnstán, might we ever have
heard of it at all. History, deprived of all its
materials, will here fail to do even late justice to
the sufferers; but it will not fail to stamp with its
enduring brand the brutal conduct of their persecutors<a id='r901' /><a href='#f901' class='c012'><sup>[901]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>However conscientious may have been the
intentions of archbishop Oda, it is to be lamented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>that a stain of barbarous cruelty attaches to his
memory, for the part he took in this transaction. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>he found it inevitable, after two years of wedded life
further to humiliate his already humbled sovereign,
by insisting upon the removal of his young consort,
it was not necessary to disfigure her with hot
searing-irons, or on her return from exile to put
her to a cruel death. The asceticism of the savage
churchman seems here to have been embittered by
even less worthy considerations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The history of mediæval Europe show’s with what
awful effect this tremendous power was wielded by
unscrupulous popes and prelates, whenever it suited
their purposes not to connive at marriages which,
according to their teaching, were incestuous. But
amidst the striking cases on record—the cases of
kings and nobles—we look in vain for a true measure
of the misery which these prohibitions must
have entailed upon the humbler members of society,
who possessed neither the influence to compel nor
the wealth to purchase dispensations from an arbitrary
and oppressive rule. The sense and feeling
of mankind at once revolt against restrictions for
which neither the law of God, nor the dictates of
nature supply excuse, and which resting upon a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>complicated calculation of affinity, were often the
means of betraying the innocent and ignorant into
a condition of endless wretchedness. But they
were invaluable engines of extortion, and instruments
of malice; they led to the intervention of
the priest with the family, in the most intolerable
form; they furnished weapons which could be used
with almost irresistible effect against those whom nothing
could reach but the tears perhaps and broken
heart of a beloved companion. And therefore they
were steadily upheld till the great day of retribution
came, which involved so many traditions of
superstition and error, so many engines of oppression
and fraud, in one common and undistinguishing
ruin: τὰ πρὶν δὲ πελώρια νῦν ἀϊστοῖ—things
mighty indeed have perished away from the world;
but thrice blessed was the day which left us free
and unshackled to pursue the noblest and purest
impulses of our human nature.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r848'>848</a>. Not to speak of Ninian, Palladius and Patricius, we may refer to
Germanus of Auxerre, who is stated to have been sent as Papal Vicar
to England, to arrest the progress of Pelagianism, at the beginning of
the fifth century. Schrödl asserts this in the broadest terms: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Auf
Bitten der Britischen Bischöfe, und gesendet von Pabst Cölestin, besuchte
der Bischof Germanus von Auxerre in der Eigenschaft eines
päbstlichen Vicars, zweimal Britannien,</span>” etc. Erste Jahrh. p. 2. Lingard
is somewhat less decided: he says, “Pope Celestine, at the representation
of the deacon Palladius, commissioned Germanus of Auxerre
to proceed in his name to Britain,” etc. Ang. Church, i. 8. Both
these authors refer to Prosper, in Chron. <i>anno</i> 429. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Papa Coelestinus
Germanum Autisiodorensem episcopum <em>vice sua</em> mittit, et deturbatis
haereticis Britannos ad Catholicam fidem dirigit.</span>” Prosper was
not only a contemporary of the facts he relates, but at a later period
actually became secretary to Celestine: his authority therefore is of
much weight. Still it is observable that Beda, in his relation, does not
attribute the mission of Germanus to the Pope. He says, that the
Britons having applied for aid to the prelates of Gaul, these held a
great synod, and <em>elected</em> Germanus and Lupus to proceed to England.
Hist. Eccl. i. 17. Beda’s account is taken from the life of Germanus
written by Constantius of Lyons, about forty years after the bishop’s
death. He says as little of the Vicariate in his account of the second
mission. However, even supposing Prosper, whose means of judgment
were certainly the best, to be right, it only follows that Celestine dispatched
Germanus as his Vicar, but not that the British prelates formally
received him in that capacity. It does not seem to me that the
passage contains any satisfactory proof that the Roman See enjoyed a
<em>right</em> of appointing Vicars in England at the period in question, however
it may have desired, or tried practically, to establish one.</p>

Such is the account Laurentius, Mellitus and Justus give in their
epistle to the Scottish prelates themselves. Beda, Hist. Eccl. ii. 4.
And the Keltic example is answered in an equally intolerant spirit
by Theodore:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui ordinati sunt Scottorum vel Brittonum episcopi,

<p class='c001'><a href='#r851'>851</a>. This seems to follow from the relation of what passed at Augustine’s
interview with the Welsh prelates. At the same time we should
judge very unwisely were we to believe missionary jealousies confined
to the nineteenth century. In the distracted state of the British the
bishops were almost the only possessors of a legal authority; and it is
not at all probable that they would have looked with equanimity on
those who came with an open proposal of subordination, even had it
been unaccompanied with circumstances wounding to their self-love.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r855'>855</a>. Deusdedit died Nov. 28th, 664. The Saxon Chronicle and Florence
assign 667 as the date of Wigheard’s mission, but this is hardly
reconcilable with the facts of the case, and appears to be an erroneous
calculation founded on the circumstance that the see was vacant three
years, and that Theodore arrived only in 668. Some time must have
elapsed from Wigheard’s departure for Rome, until the interchange of
letters between Oswiú and Pope Vitalian, and the completion of the
negotiations which resulted in Theodore’s appointment.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f856'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r856'>856</a>. The want of an archbishop to give canonical ordination to bishops,
seems to have forced itself upon their notice. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hunc antistitem ordinandum
Romam miserunt; quatenus accepto ipso gradu archiepiscopatus,
catholicos per omnem Britanniam aecclesiis Anglorum ordinare
posset antistites.</span>” Beda, H. E. iv. 29. It was at all events a good argument,
though the difficulty was one which Gaul had often arranged.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f857'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r857'>857</a>. This event has naturally been discussed with very different views.
The Roman Catholics construe it to imply a recognized right in the
Roman See: the Protestants look upon it as rather a piece of skilful
man&oelig;uvring on the part of the Pope. Lappenberg (i. 172) says: “The
death of Wigheard was taken advantage of by the Pope to set over the
Anglosaxon bishops a primate devoted to his views.” “This opportunity
was not lost upon Italian subtlety. Vitalian, then Pope, determined
upon trying whether the Anglosaxons would receive an archbishop
nominated by himself.” Soames, Anglos. Church, p. 78. Against
this, of course, Lingard has expatiated in his Hist. and Antiq. i. 75.
He attributes the selection of Theodore to a <em>request</em> of the two kings,
and adds in a note: “That such was their request is certain. Beda
calls Theodore, who was selected by Vitalian, ‘the archbishop asked
for by the king’—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">episcopum quem petierant a Romano pontifice</span> (Bed.
iv. c. 1)—and ‘the bishop whom the country had anxiously sought’—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">doctorem
veritatis, quem patria sedula quaesierat.</span> Id. Op. Min. p. 142.
Vitalian, in his answer to the two kings, reminds them that their letter
requested him to choose a bishop for them in the case of Wigheard’s
death—‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundum vestrorum scriptorum tenorem.</span>’ Bed. iii. 29. Certainly
these passages must have escaped the eye of Mr. Soames, who
boldly, and without an atom of authority for his statement, ascribes
the choice of a bishop by Vitalian to Italian subtlety.” Mr. Churton
in his Early English Church, p. 67, inclines also to this view, which is
again combated by Soames in his Latin Church, etc. p. 80 <i>seq.</i>; but
this author with a happy skill which he sometimes manifests of not
seeing disagreeable data, says nothing of the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quem petierant</i></span> a Romano
pontifice.” Yet in these words lies the matter of the whole dispute.
It certainly does not appear from Vitalian’s letter, that any such
contingency as Wigheard’s death was provided for by the kings; this
is in itself extremely improbable, and the assertion is an evidence of
Lingard’s rashness where the interests of his party are concerned. But
is it not on the other hand very probable that more letters passed between
the kings and the pope than are now recorded? that Vitalian
announced Wigheard’s death, and that the kings, conscious of the difficulty
of coming to any second settlement in such a state of society as
their own (especially as they were but two of four very equally poised
authorities), fairly asked him to solve the problem for them? I greatly
doubt the strict adherence to canonical forms of election in the seventh
century; and indeed throughout the history of the English church it
appears that the kings dealt very much at their own pleasure in the
appointment of bishops. It could hardly be otherwise with a clergy
dispersed through so many heterogeneous fractions as then made up
England: and if it is now much to be desired that the appointment by
the central authority should spare the church the scandal which might
ensue from the canonical election of bishops—strictly construed—(for
acted upon strictly it never has been under any orderly and strong
government, since Christianity began), it was much more necessary
then, when the clergy belonged to hostile populations. That central
authority was royalty, recognized wherever found.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f858'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r858'>858</a>. Boniface found an ancient church even in Germany. Vit. Bonif.
Pertz, ii. 341. He rendered it a papal one. It is no doubt difficult
to imagine how it could have been originally anything else; but at
all events his efforts brought it back into subjection to the Vatican.
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D’abord les églises de la Grand Bretagne et de l’Allemagne, fondées
par les missionaires du pape, furent toutes rattachées et subordonnées
à l’épiscopat Romain. C’est surtout Saint Boniface, le
fondateur de l’église Allemande, mort en 755, qui reserra cette union.
Ou diminua partout les métropolitains, et les simples évêques devinrent
plus indépendans par leurs rapports directs avec Rome.</span>”
Warnkönig, Hist. du Droit Belgique, p. 163. The spirit in which
Boniface considered his mission, which he himself calls <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>apostolicae
sedis legatio</i></span> (Vita, Pertz, ii. 342) is apparent from the correspondence
with Pope Gregory III. in 731. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Denuo Romam nuntii eius
venerunt, sanctumque sedis Apostolicae pontificem adlocuti sunt,
eique prioris amicitiae foedera, quae misericorditer ab antecessore suo,
Sancto Bonifatio eiusque familiae conlata sunt, manifestaverunt; sed
et devotam eius in futurum humilitatis apostolicae sedi subiectionem
narraverunt, et ut familiaritati ac communioni sancti pontificis atque
totius sedis apostolicae ex hoc devote subiectus communicaret, quemadmodum
edocti erant, praecabantur. Statim ergo sedis apostolicae
Papa pacificum profert responsum, et suam sedisque apostolicae familiaritatis
et amicitiae communionem tam sancto Bonifatio quam etiam
sibi subiectis condonavit, sumptoque archiepiscopatus pallio, cum muneribus
diversisque sanctorum reliquiis legatos honorifice remisit ad
patriam.</span>” Pertz, ii. 345. With such provocation, the Popes would
indeed have acted an unwise part in not availing themselves of the
ready service of their Anglosaxon converts!</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f859'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r859'>859</a>. Mr. Soames very cursorily says: “Augustine received about the
same time from Gregory the insidious compliment of a pall. He was
charged also to establish twelve suffragan bishops, and to select an
archbishop for the see of York. Over this prelate, who was likewise to
have under his jurisdiction twelve suffragan sees, he had a personal
grant of precedence. After his death the two archbishops were to
rank according to priority of consecration.” Anglosax. Church, p. 55.
The language, thus most carefully selected, is intended to meet any
argument which might be derived from the despatch of the pallium, in
token of assumption of authority by the Pope. But there can be little
doubt, whatever its original character may have been, that this distinction
was both intended and accepted as a mark of the archiepiscopal
dignity, and as conveying powers which without it could not be exercised.
This was obviously the way Beda understood it, and Gregory
meant it to be understood. In his answers to Augustine’s questions,
one of which referred to the relations which were to subsist between
the Gallican and English churches, the pope thus refuses to give his
missionary any authority over the continental bishops:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In Galliarum
episcopis nullam tibi auctoritatem tribuimus; quia ab antiquis praedecessorum
meorum temporibus pallium Arelatensis episcopus accepit,
quem nos privare auctoritate percepta minime debemus.</span>” Hist. Eccl.
i. 27. And in a subsequent letter to Augustine the same pope writes:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et
quia nova Anglorum aecclesia ad omnipotentis Dei gratiam, eodem
Domino largiente et te laborante, perducta est, usum tibi pallii in ea
ad sola missarum solemnia agenda concedimus: <em>ita ut</em> per loca singula
duodecim episcopos ordines, qui tuae subiaceant ditioni, quatenus Lundoniensis
civitatis episcopus semper in posterum a synodo propria
debeat consecrari, atque honoris pallium ab hac sancta et apostolica,
cui Deo auctore deservio, sede precipiat. Ad Eburacam vero civitatem
te volumus episcopum mittere, quem ipse iudicaveris ordinare; ita
duntaxat, ut si eadem civitas cum finitimis locis verbum Dei receperit,
ipse quoque duodecim episcopos ordinet, et metropolitani honore perfruatur;
<em>quia</em> ei quoque, si vita comes fuerit, pallium tribuere Domino
favente disponimus.</span>” Beda, Hist. Eccl. i. 29. On which Beda remarks:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Misit
etiam litteras in quibus significat se ei pallium direxisse,
simul et insinuat qualiter episcopos in Britannia constituere
debuisset.</span>” Thirty years later, Pope Honorius sent palls both to
Paulinus of York and Honorius of Canterbury, with letters to Eádwini
of Northumberland; in these he says:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Duo pallia utrorumque
metropolitanorum, id est Honorio et Paulino direximus, ut dum quis
eorum de hoc saeculo ad Auctorem suum fuerit arcessitus, in loco ipsius
alter episcopum ex hac nostra auctoritate debeat subrogare.</span>” Hist. Eccl.
ii. 17. The reason of this Beda tells us was the inconvenience of going
to Rome for archiepiscopal ordination:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne sit necesse ad Romanam
usque civitatem per tam prolixa terrarum et maris spatia pro ordinando
archiepiscopo semper fatigari.</span>” Hist. Eccl. ii. 18. We learn from
Honorius’s letter to the archbishop of Canterbury, that this alleviation
was granted at the petition of the English kings and prelates:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et
tam iuxta vestram petitionem, quam filiorum nostrorum regum, vobis
per praesentem nostram praeceptionem, vice beati Petri apostolorum
principis, auctoritatem tribuimus, ut quando unum ex vobis Divina ad
se iusserit gratia vocari, is qui superstes fuerit, alterum in loco defuncti
debeat episcopum ordinare. Pro qua etiam re singula vestrae dilectioni
pallia pro eadem ordinatione celebranda direximus, ut per nostrae praeceptionis
auctoritatem possitis Deo placitam ordinationem efficere: quia
ut haec vobis concederemus, longa terrarum marisque intervalla, quae
inter nos ac vos obsistunt, ad haec nos condescendere coegerunt.</span>”
Hist. Eccl. ii. 18. The archiepiscopate in York ceased after Paulinus’s
expulsion till 735, when it was restored, king Eádberht having succeeded
in obtaining a pall for his brother Ecgberht. The short chronicle appended
to Beda says:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ecgberhtus episcopus, accepto ab apostolica
sede pallio, primus post Paulinum in archiepiscopatum confirmatus
est; ordinavitque Fridubertum et Friduwaldum episcopos.</span>” See also

<p class='c001'>Wendover states that when Offa determined to erect Lichfield into an
archbishopric, he sent to Pope Adrian for a pall; and that the pall
was accordingly dispatched, Rog. Wend. i. 138.</p>

<p class='c001'>The avarice of the Roman See was thus fed fat: but the inconveniences
were felt to be so intolerable, that in 1031 Cnut made them
the subject of an especial remonstrance to the Pope. In his letter to
the Witan of England he says, writing from Rome:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conquestus
sum iterum coram domino papa et mihi valde displicere causabar, quod
mei archiepiscopi in tantum angariabantur immensitate pecuniarum
quae ab eis expetebatur, dum pro pallio accipiendo, secundum morem,
apostolicam sedem peterent; decretumque est ne ita deinceps fieret.</span>”
Epist. Cnut. apud Flor. Wig. 1031. The question is not whether the
Roman See had a right to make a demand, but whether—usurpation or
not—it was acquiesced in and admitted by the Anglosaxon church;
and on that point there can be no dispute.</p>

disregard the complaint that the “Spouse of Christ” was in bondage.
In this respect our own country has generally been honourably distinguished.
Boniface—himself an Englishman, papal beyond all his contemporaries—laments
that no church is in greater bondage than the
English,—a noble testimony to the nationality of the institution, the
common sense of the people, and the vigour of the State.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r862'>862</a>. Though monks are not strictly speaking the clergy, so many prelates
and presbyters were bound by monastic vows in this country,
that I might be supposed to have fallen into confusion here, and forgotten
the troubles of Eádwig’s reign. But it will be seen hereafter
that I attach little credit to the exaggerations of the monkish authors
respecting those events, and believe their clients to have done much
less mischief than they themselves have recorded, or than their modern
antagonists have credited.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f863'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r863'>863</a>. See on this subject Lingard, Anglos. Church, i. 89 <i>seq.</i> His view
seems upon the whole satisfactory, and conformable to truth.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f864'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r864'>864</a>. Lingard attributes this to the intrigues of Wini, whose simoniacal
bargain for the see of London does certainly not give a favourable impression
of his character. “The influence of the stranger was secretly
undermined by the intrigues of Wini, a Saxon ecclesiastic, who possessed
the advantage of conversing with the king in his native tongue.”
Anglos. Church, i. 90. But Beda says nothing of this: he merely
hints that Coinwalh was disgusted with the difficulties which arose
from Ægilberht’s ignorance of the Anglosaxon language. The whole
transaction is thus related in the Hist. Eccl. iii. 7:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum vero
restitutus esset in regnum Coinwalch, venit in provinciam de Hibernia
pontifex quidam nomine Agilberctus, natione quidem Gallus, sed tunc
legendarum gratia Scripturarum in Hibernia non parvo tempore demoratus,
coniunxitque se regi, sponte ministerium praedicandi adsumens:
cuius eruditionem atque industriam videns rex rogavit eum, accepta
ibi sede episcopali, suae genti manere pontificem. Qui precibus eius
adnuens, multis annis eidem genti sacerdotali iure praefuit. Tandem
rex, qui Saxonum tantum linguam noverat, pertaesus barbarae loquelae,
subintroduxit in provinciam alium suae linguae episcopum vocabulo
Uini, et ipsum in Gallia ordinatum: dividensque in duas parochias
provinciam, huic in civitate Venta, quae a gente Saxonum Uintancestir
appellatur, sedem episcopalem tribuit; unde offensus graviter Agilberctus,
quod hoc ipso inconsulto ageret rex, rediit Galliam, et accepto
episcopatu Parisiacae civitatis, ibidem senex et plenus dierum obiit.
Non multis autem annis post abcessum eius a Britannia transactis,
pulsus est Uini ab eodem rege de episcopatu; qui secedens ad regem
Merciorum, vocabulo Uulfheri, emit pretio ab eodem sedem Lundoniae
civitatis, eiusque episcopus usque ad vitae suae terminum mansit.</span>”
Wessex then remained for some time without a bishop, till Coinwalh
sent to Ægilberht and invited him to return. The Frankish prelate
replied that he could not desert his church and see, but recommended
his nephew Lothaire, as a proper person to be ordained to Wessex:
and he was accordingly consecrated by Theodore: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo honorifice a
populo et a rege suscepto, rogaverunt Theodorum, tunc archiepiscopum
Doruvernensis ecclesiae, ipsum sibi antistitem consecrari.</span>” Hist. Eccl.

have we of instruments respecting matters which are entirely beyond
doubt? Supposing a royal mandate of consecration had issued on the
election of every bishop, between 802, when Ecgberht came to the
throne, and 1066, there would have been once in existence 36 archiepiscopal
and 224 episcopal writs, or a total of 260. But during the
same period, in the 32 counties south of the Humber there would have
been held 25,344 shiremoots or county-courts. I will deduct one half
of this number to meet all conceivable accidents. Of the 12,672, of
which beyond a doubt records once existed, we still possess <em>three</em> or at
the utmost <em>four</em> instruments: but do we on that account doubt that
shiremoots were held? When we look at these ratios of 1 : 260 and
4 : 12,672, we find the authority for the writ of consecration more than
ten times as great as that for the existence of shiremoots.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r883'>883</a>. The ‘Institutes of Ecclesiastical Polity’ are very explicit upon
these points. They say:—“To a bishop belongs every direction, both
in divine and worldly things. He shall, in the first place, inform men
in orders, so that each of them may know what it properly behoves
him to do, and also what they have to enjoin to secular men. He shall
ever be [busied] about reconciliation and peace, as he best may. He
shall zealously appease strifes and effect peace, with those temporal
judges who love right. He shall in accusations direct the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>lád</i></span>, so that
no man may wrong another, either in oath or ordeal. He shall not
consent to any injustice, or wrong measure, or false weight; but it is
fitting that every legal right (both ‘<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burhriht</span>’ and ‘<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">landriht</span>’) go by
his counsel and with his witness: and let every burgmeasure, and every
balance for weighing be, by his direction and furthering, very exact;
lest any man should wrong another, and thereby altogether too greatly
sin.... It behoves all Christian men to love righteousness, and shun
unrighteousness; and especially men in orders should ever exalt righteousness,
and suppress unrighteousness: therefore should bishops,
together with temporal judges, so direct judgments, that, as far as in
them lies, they never permit any injustice to spring up there.... By
the confessor’s direction, and by his own measure, it is justly fitting
that the thralls work for their lords over all the district in which he
shrives. And it is right that there be not one measuring-rod longer
than another, but all regulated by the confessor’s measure; and let
every measure in his shrift-district, and every weight, be, by his direction,
very rightly regulated: and if there be any dispute, let the bishop
arbitrate.” Thorpe, ii. 312 <i>seq.</i></p>

Anglorum gentis episcopo, alumno videlicet, ut recordaris, tuo, de consanguinitatis
coniunctione, ipsi et Anglorum genti, quae nuper ad fidem

Augustini. Usque ad quotam generationem fideles debeant

copulari coniugio? Respondit Gregorius. Quaedam terrena lex in
Romana republica permittit ut, sive frater et soror, seu duorum fratrum
germanorum, vel duarum sororum filius et filia misceantur; sed experimento
didicimus ex tali coniugio sobolem non posse succrescere, et
Sacra Lex prohibet cognationis turpitudinem revelare. Unde necesse
est ut iam tertia vel quarta generatio fidelium licenter sibi iungi debeat;
nam secunda, quam praediximus, a se omni modo debet abstinere.
Cum noverca autem miscere grave est facinus, quia et in Lege scriptum
est, ‘Turpitudinem patris tui non revelabis’.... Quia vero sunt
multi in Anglorum gente qui, dum adhuc in infidelitate essent, huic

seem to prove that Eádbald’s marriage was closely connected with
heathendom,—perhaps was intended to be a public profession of it.
He says that the king, being terrified by Laurentius’s account of a miraculous
vision he had had, “anathematizato omni idolatriae cultu,
abdicato connubio non legitimo, suscepit fidem Christi, et baptizatus
aecclesiae rebus quantum valuit, in omnibus consulere et favere curavit.”
Hist. Eccl. ii. 6. In fact the politics of that day seem generally
to have consisted in the apostasy of a converted king’s successor. The
heathen priests could hardly be expected to yield quite without a
struggle. The cases are curious enough to merit a detailed record.

to us; but there is some probability that Æðelwulf’s marriage was
never really consummated, that it was never a marriage at all. Judith
can hardly have been more than twelve when Æðelwulf married her,
and within two years he died.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f900'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r900'>900</a>. Eádbald’s divorce is recorded, as we have seen, by Beda. Æðelbald’s
rests on much less sure authority,—that only of Matthew
Westminster, and Rudborne, Annal. Winton. Judith, after her return
to France, eloped with Baldwin of Flanders, to whom she bore Matilda,
William the Conqueror’s wife. See Warnkönig, Hist. Fland. i. 144.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r901'>901</a>. There cannot be the slightest doubt that Ælfgyfu was Eádwig’s
wife, or that she was separated from him on the ground of too near
consanguinity. The charter, Cod. Dipl. No. 1201, which is in every
respect an authentic document, mentions her as “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Ælfgyfu, ðæs cynges
wíf,</span>” the king’s wife; and this, in addition to herself, was witnessed by
her mother Æðelgyfu, by four bishops, and by three principal noblemen
of the court. If that charter be not genuine, there is not one genuine
in the whole Codex Diplomaticus, and I cannot see the shadow of a reason
to question it, as Lingard has done. The reader will probably be
glad to see it, as it occurs in <em>two</em> manuscripts, the Cotton MSS. Claud.

the other a statement in Latin drawn up from it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Latin abstract of this important document is as follows:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dominus

Cenintun, concedente eodem rege, egit apud Brihtelmum episcopum.

Crydanbricge. Testes autem fuerunt huius commutationis Ælfgifa regis
uxor, et Æðelgifa mater eius, Ælfsige episcopus, Osulfus episcopus,
Kenwald episcopus, et multi alii.</span>” The date of this document is 956,
in which year Eádwig came to the throne, and therefore certainly subsequent
to the coronation, the celebrated scene of Dúnstán’s insolence.
The prelates and nobles present were Ælfsige bishop of Winchester,
Oswulf bishop of Ramsbury, Cénwald bishop of Worcester, Byrhthelm
bishop of London, Æðelwald then abbot of Abingdon and afterwards
the celebrated bishop of Winchester—the Father of the Monks, as he
was called; Byrhtnóð the ealdorman an equally decided patron of the
monastic order; Ælfheáh no less a man than the dapifer regis, or seneschal
of Eádwig’s house. This then was not a thing done in a corner,
and the testimony is conclusive that Ælfgyfu was Eádwig’s queen. It
is also beyond doubt that, in the year 958, Oda separated Eádwig from
his wife on the ground of their being too nearly related: one of the
MSS. of the Saxon Chronicle says clearly, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Her on ðissum geare Oda
arcebiscop tótwǽmde Eádwi cyning and Ælfgyfe, forðám ðe hí wǽron tó
gesybbe.</span>” Chron. Sax. an. 958. And Florence of Worcester, drawing
from an independent authority, but evidently confused by the slanderous
tales which had been spread of Eádwig, confirms the Chronicle, saying:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sanctus
Odo Doruberniae archiepiscopus regem Westsaxonum
Eádwium et Ælfgivam, vel quia, ut fertur, propinqua illius extitit, vel
quia illam sub propria uxore adamavit, ab invicem separavit.</span>” Flor.
Wig. an. 958. William of Malmesbury speaks of her as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">uxor, proxime
cognata</span>” (Gest. Reg. § 147, i. 223), but soon after calls her <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ganea</i></span> and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pellex</i></span> in choice monkish style. Wendover and Paris are even more
insolent in their phraseology, but still there is the unlucky admission of
a marriage:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Huic [sc. Eádwig] quaedam mulier inepta, licet natione
praecelsa</span> [certainly very high birth indeed if Ælfgyfu was too near a relative
of the king] <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum adulta filia per nefandum familiaritatis lenocinium
adhaerebat, ut sese vel filiam suam sub coniugali titulo sociaret.</span>”
Wendov. i. 404. They go on to insinuate that there was an improper
familiarity between the king and both the women. With this I am
not at all concerned: Eádwig may have been a disorderly young prince,
as there have been other disorderly young princes,—as his much-belauded
brother Eádgar <em>was</em> in the highest degree. The ladies <em>may</em> have
been more than commonly depraved. But it may be observed that our
general experience is not in favour of a wife’s permitting her husband
to be guilty of lascivious conduct towards another woman in her presence,
or of a married daughter’s conniving at her husband’s irregularities
with her own mother. Not a word have we of this disgusting insinuation
in the Chronicle, or Florence,—himself a monk,—or Æðelweard,
or Huntingdon: and the two latter speak of Eádwig in terms
very far removed from those in which the adherents of Dúnstán’s cause
have chosen to characterize him:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quin successor eius Eáduuig in
regnum, qui et, prae nimia etenim pulchritudine, Pancali sortitus est
nomen a vulgo secundi. Tenuit namque quadriennio per regnum

cum in principio regni eius decentissime floruerit, prospera et laetabunda
exordia mors immatura perrupit.</span>” Hen. Hunt. lib. v. We must be
excused for preferring this sort of record to the interested exaggerations
of such biographers as Bridferð, whom the remainder of his
work proves to have been either a very weak and credulous person
or a very great rogue, or—as not unfrequently happens—perhaps both
at once.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER IX. <br /> THE CLERGY AND MONKS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The almost total absence of documentary evidence
leaves us in great doubt as to the condition of the
church in England previous to the organization
brought about by Theodore. It is nevertheless probable
that it followed in all essential points the
course which characterized other missionary establishments.
The earliest missionaries were for the
most part monks; but Augustine was accompanied
by clerics also<a id='r902' /><a href='#f902' class='c012'><sup>[902]</sup></a>, and in every case the conversion
of a district was rapidly followed by the establishment
of a cathedral or a corresponding ecclesiastical
foundation. These were at first central stations,
from which the assembled clergy sallied forth
to visit the neighbouring villages and towns, and
preach the tidings of salvation: the necessities of
daily provision, the attainment of greater security
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>for their persons, the mutual aid and consolation
in the perils and difficulties of their task, all supplied
motives in favour of a c&oelig;nobitical mode of
life: monks and clerics were confounded together
through the circumstances of the adventure in
which they shared; nay the very administration of
those rites by which the imagination of the heathen
Saxons was so strongly worked upon, could only
be conducted on a sufficiently imposing scale by an
assemblage of ecclesiastics. To this must be added
the protection to be derived from settling on one
spot, in the immediate neighbourhood of a royal
vill, and under the safeguard of the royal power:
for though the residences of kings were rarely in
cities, yet their proximity offered much more secure
guarantees than the outlying villages and
clearings in the mark; even as the general tendencies
of courtly life were likely to present fewer
points of opposition than the characteristic bigotry
of heathen, <i>i. e.</i> rural populations. This combination
of circumstances probably led at an early period
to that approximation between the modes of
life of monks and clerks, which at the close of the
eighth century Chrodogang succeeded in enforcing
in his archbishopric of Metz, but which had been
attempted four centuries earlier by Eusebius of
Vercelli<a id='r903' /><a href='#f903' class='c012'><sup>[903]</sup></a>. Both the Roman and Scottish missionaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>followed the same plan, which indeed appears
to be the natural one, and to have been generally
adopted on all similar occasions, whether in ancient
Germany, in Peru or in the most modern missions
of Australia or New Zealand. In Beda’s Ecclesiastical
History, which in these respects no
doubt was founded upon ancient and contemporary
records, we frequently read of prelates leaving their
monasteries (by which general name churches as
well as collections of monks are designated) to
preach the Gospel and administer the rite of baptism
in distant villages<a id='r904' /><a href='#f904' class='c012'><sup>[904]</sup></a>. But this system had also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>inconveniences of no slight character; the distance
of the converts from the church, the necessity for
daily superintendence and continual exhortation
on the part of the preacher, the very danger and
fatigue of repeated journeys into rude, uncultivated
parts of the country, must have soon forced upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>the clergy the necessity of providing other machinery
than they as yet possessed. The multiplication
of centres of instruction was the first and
greatest point to be ensured; whereby a more
constant intercourse between the neophyte and the
missionary might be attained. This had long been
secured in other countries by the appointment of
single presbyters to reside in single districts, under
the general direction of the bishop; or, where
circumstances required it, by the settlement of
several presbyters under an archipresbyter or archpriest,
who was responsible for the conduct of his
companions. And as the district of the bishop
himself commonly went by the name of a diocese
or parish, both these terms were applied to denote
the smaller circuit within which the presbyter was
expected to exert himself for the propagation of the
faith, and the due performance of the established
rites, and to perform such functions as had been
entrusted to the ministers of the faithful, for the
better management of the ecclesiastical affairs of
the congregation. The custom of the neighbouring
countries of Gaul offered sufficient evidence of
the practicability of such an arrangement, which
had long been in use in older established churches:
we may therefore readily suppose that so beneficial
a system would be adopted with all convenient
speed in England. As long as the possessions of
the clergy were confined to a small plot whereon
their church was built, and while they depended
for support upon the contributions in kind which
the rude piety of their new converts bestowed, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>bishops could naturally not proceed to plant these
clerical colonies of their own authority: though,
as soon as they became masters of vills and manors
and estates of their own, they probably adopted the
plan of sending single presbyters into them, partly
to discharge the clerical duties of their station,
partly to act as stewards, administrators or bailiffs
of the property, the proceeds of which were paid
over to the episcopal church, and laid out at the
discretion of the bishop<a id='r905' /><a href='#f905' class='c012'><sup>[905]</sup></a>. But the zeal of the
people could here assist the benevolent objects of
the clergy. The inconvenience of having a distance
to traverse in order to attend the ministrations of
religion, the desire to aid in the meritorious work
of the conversion, the earnest hope to establish a
peculiar claim upon the favour of Heaven, nay
perhaps even the less worthy motives of vanity and
ambition, disposed the landowner to raise a church
upon his own estate for the use of himself and his
surrounding tenants or friends. From a very early
period this disposition was cultivated and encouraged;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>and the bishops relinquished the patronage
of the church to the founder, reserving of course
to themselves the canonical subjection and consecration
of the presbyter who was ordained to the
title. During the seventh century this had become
common in the Frankish empire, and Theodore followed,
or introduced, the same rule in this country<a id='r906' /><a href='#f906' class='c012'><sup>[906]</sup></a>.
Whether under this influence or not, we find
churches to have so arisen during his government
of the English sees, whose sole archbishop he was.
Beda incidentally mentions the dedication by John
of Beverley of churches, for Puch and Addi, two
Northumbrian noblemen, and these were no doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>private foundations<a id='r907' /><a href='#f907' class='c012'><sup>[907]</sup></a>. We still possess various regulations
of Theodore, and of nearly contemporary
prelates, which refer to such separate churches,
proving how very general they had become, and
how strictly they required to be guarded against the
avarice or other unworthy motives of the founders,
and the simoniacal practices both of priest and layman.
In the thirty-eighth chapter of his Capitula<a id='r908' /><a href='#f908' class='c012'><sup>[908]</sup></a>
we find the following directions:—“Any presbyter
who shall have obtained a parish by means of a
price, is absolutely to be deposed, seeing that he is
known to hold it contrary to the discipline of
ecclesiastical rule. And likewise, he who shall by
means of money have expelled a presbyter lawfully
ordained to a church, and so have obtained it
entirely for himself; which vice, so widely diffused,
is to be remedied with the utmost zeal. Also it is
to be forbidden both to clerks and laics, that no
one shall presume to give any church whatever to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>a presbyter, without the licence and consent of the
bishop.” These churches frequently were granted
to abbeys or to the bishops themselves; and in the
latter case they were served by priests especially
appointed thereunto from the cathedral<a id='r909' /><a href='#f909' class='c012'><sup>[909]</sup></a>. At this
early period when tithes were not demandable as
matter of right, and when the founders of these
churches were already betraying a tendency to speculate
in church-building, by claiming for themselves
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>altare</i></span> or produce of the voluntary oblations
of the faithful, the bishops found it necessary
to insist that every church should be endowed with
a sufficient glebe or estate in land: the amount
fixed was one hide, equivalent to the estate of a
single family, which, properly managed, would
support the presbyter and his attendant clerks.
Archbishop Ecgberht rules<a id='r910' /><a href='#f910' class='c012'><sup>[910]</sup></a>: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut unicuique aecclesiae
vel una mansa integra absque alio servitio
attribuatur, et presbyteri in eis constituti non de
decimis neque de oblationibus fidelium nec de domibus,
neque de atriis vel hortis iuxta aecclesiam
positis, neque de praescripta mansa, aliquod servitium
faciant, praeter aecclesiasticum: et si aliquod
amplius habuerint, inde senioribus suis, secundum
patriae morem, debitum servitium impendant.</span>”
And this regulation, though probably already established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>by custom, obtained the force of law in the
Frankish empire, by a constitution of Hludwich
in 816<a id='r911' /><a href='#f911' class='c012'><sup>[911]</sup></a>. This glebe-land the bishop seems not to
have been able to interfere with, so as to alienate
it from the particular church, in favour of another,
even when both churches were within his own subjection<a id='r912' /><a href='#f912' class='c012'><sup>[912]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But although many churches may have arisen in
this manner, a large proportion of which gradually
found their way into the hands of bishops and
abbots, and although these last may have erected
churches, as the necessities of the case demanded,
in the various districts over which they exercised
rights of property, the greater number of
parish-churches (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>plebes</i>, <i>aecclesiae baptismales</i>, <i>tituli
maiores</i></span>) had probably a very different origin. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>had been shown that in all likelihood every Mark
had its religious establishment, its <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fanum</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>delubrum</i></span>,
or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sacellum</i></span>, as the Latin authors call them, its
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>hearh</i></span>, as the Anglosaxon no doubt designated
them<a id='r913' /><a href='#f913' class='c012'><sup>[913]</sup></a>; and further, that the priest or priests
attached to these heathen churches had lands—perhaps
freewill offerings too—for their support.
It has also been shown that a well-grounded plan
of turning the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>religio loci</i></span> to account was acted
upon by all the missionaries, and that wherever a
substantial building was found in existence, it was
taken possession of for the behoof of the new religion.
Under such circumstances it would seem
that nothing could be more natural than the establishment
of a baptismal church in every independent
mark that adopted Christianity, and that the
substitution of one creed for the other not only did
not require the abolition of the old machinery, but
would be much facilitated by retaining it. It is in
this manner then that I understand the assertions
of Beda and others, that certain missionary prelates
established churches <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per loca</i></span>, such churches
being certainly not cathedrals<a id='r914' /><a href='#f914' class='c012'><sup>[914]</sup></a> or abbey-churches.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>There cannot be the least reason to doubt that
parish-churches were generally established in the
time of Beda, less than half a century after the
period to which most of the instances in the notes
refer<a id='r915' /><a href='#f915' class='c012'><sup>[915]</sup></a>: and it is not very probable that they were
all owing to private liberality. In a similar manner
probably arose the numerous parish-churches
which before the close of the eighth century were
founded, especially by the English missionaries,
on the continent of Europe<a id='r916' /><a href='#f916' class='c012'><sup>[916]</sup></a>. Thus in the seventh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>century in England the ecclesiastical machinery
consisted of episcopal churches served by a body
of clerks or monks,—sometimes united under the
same rule, and a sufficient number of whom had
the necessary orders of priests, deacons and the
like; probably also churches served by a number
of presbyters under the guidance of an archipresbyter
or archpriest<a id='r917' /><a href='#f917' class='c012'><sup>[917]</sup></a>, bearing some resemblance to
our later collegiate foundations; and numerous
parish-churches established on the sites of the
ancient fanes in the marks, or erected by the liberality
of kings, bishops and other landowners on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>their own manorial estates. The wealthy and
powerful had also their own private chaplains, who
performed the rites of religion in their oratories<a id='r918' /><a href='#f918' class='c012'><sup>[918]</sup></a>,
and who even at this early period probably bore
the name of handpreostas, by which in much later
times they were distinguished from the túnpreostas,
village or parochial priests<a id='r919' /><a href='#f919' class='c012'><sup>[919]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>As early as the fifth century the fourth general
council (Chalcedon, an. 451) had laid down the
rule that the ecclesiastical and political establishments
should be assimilated as much as possible<a id='r920' /><a href='#f920' class='c012'><sup>[920]</sup></a>;
and as the central power was represented by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>metropolitans and the bishops, so the subsidiary
authorities had their corresponding functionaries
in the parish priests, priests of collegiate churches
and their dependents. We possess a curious
parallel drawn by Walafrid Strabo in the earliest
years of the ninth century, on this subject. In his
book <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Exordiis Rerum Aecclesiasticarum</span> (cap.
31), he thus compares the civil and ecclesiastical
polities: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porro sicut comites quidam Missos
suos praeponunt popularibus, qui minores causas
determinent, ipsis maiora reservent, ita quidam
episcopi chorepiscopos habent. Centenarii qui et
centuriones et Vicarii, qui per pagos statuti sunt,
Presbyteris Plebei, qui baptismales aecclesias tenent,
et minoribus praesunt Presbyteris, conferri
queunt. Decuriones et Decani, qui sub ipsis vicariis
quaedam minora exercent, Presbyteris titulorum
possunt comparari. Sub ipsis ministris centenariorum
sunt adhuc minores qui Collectarii,
Quaterniones, et Duumviri possunt appellari, qui
colligunt populum, et ipso numero ostendunt se
decanis esse minores. Sunt autem ista vocabula
ab antiquitate mutuata,</span>” etc<a id='r921' /><a href='#f921' class='c012'><sup>[921]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>Both in spiritual and in temporal matters, the
clergymen thus dispersed over the face of the
country were accountable to the bishop, whose
<em>vicars</em> they were taken to be, that is to say, in
whose place (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quorum vice</span>”) they performed their
functions. The “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">presbyteri plebei</span>” or parish priests
had the administration of all the sacraments and
rites, except those reserved to the bishop,—such
for instance as confirmation, ordination, the consecration
of churches, the chrism, and the like: these
were denied them, but they could baptize, marry,
bury, and administer the communion. And gradually,
as matter of convenience, they were invested
with the internal jurisdiction, as it was called,—the
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">iurisdictio fori interni,</span>”—that is to say
confession, penance and absolution, but solely as
representatives and vicars of the bishop<a id='r922' /><a href='#f922' class='c012'><sup>[922]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>It was this gradual extension of the powers of
the presbyter that destroyed the distinction between
the collegiate churches served by the archpriest
and his clergy, and the church in which a single
presbyter administered the daily rites of religion.
The word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>parochia</i></span> which at first had been properly
confined to the former churches, became generally
applied to the latter, when the difference between
their spiritual privileges entirely vanished.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the theory of the early church, the whole district
subject to the rule of the bishop formed but
one integral mass: the parochial clergy even in
spirituals were but the bishop’s ministers or vicars,
and in temporals they were accountable to him for
every gain which accrued to the church. This he
was to distribute at his own discretion; it is true
that there were canons of the church which in some
degree regulated his conduct, and probably the
presbyters of his cathedral, his witan or council, did
not neglect to offer their advice on so interesting a
subject. To him it belonged to assign the funds
for the support of the parochial clergy, out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>share which was commanded to be set apart for the
sustenance of the ministers of the altar: to him
also it belonged to apportion the share which was
directed to be applied to the repairs of the fabric of
the churches in his diocese; and he also had the
immediate distribution of that portion which was
devoted to the charitable purposes of relieving the
poor and ransoming the enslaved,—a noble privilege,
more valuable in rude days like those than in
our civilized age it could be, even had the sacrilegious
hand of time not removed it from among
the jewels of the mitre.</p>

<p class='c001'>Occasionally, no doubt, the parochial clergy,
though supported by their glebe-lands, had reason
to complain that the hospitality or charity of the
bishop, exceeding the bounds of the canonical division,
left them but an insufficient remuneration for
their services: and more than one council found it
useful to impress upon the prelate the claims of his
less fortunate or deserving brethren<a id='r923' /><a href='#f923' class='c012'><sup>[923]</sup></a>: but on the
whole there can be little question that piety on the
one hand and superstition on the other combined
to supply an ample fund for the support of the
clerical body; and that what with free-will offerings,
grants of lands, fines, rents, tithes, compulsory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>contributions, and the sums paid in commutation
of penance, the clergy in England were at all times
provided not only with the means of comfort, but
even with wealth and splendour. The sources and
nature of ecclesiastical income will form the subject
of a separate chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a body the clergy in England were placed
very high in the social scale: the valuable services
which they rendered to their fellow-creatures,—their
dignity as ministers and stewards of the mysteries
of the faith,—lastly the ascetical course of life which
many of them adopted, struck the imagination and
secured the admiration of their rude contemporaries.
At first too, they were honourably distinguished
by the possession of arts and learning, which
could be found in no other class; and although the
most celebrated of their commentaries upon the
Biblical books or the works of the Fathers, do not
now excite in us any very great feelings of respect,
they must have had a very different effect upon our
simple progenitors. Whatever state of ignorance
the body generally may have fallen into in the ninth
and tenth centuries, the seventh and eighth had
produced men famous in every part of Europe
for the soundness and extent of their learning. To
them England owed the more accurate calculations
which enabled the divisions of times and seasons to
be duly settled; the decency, nay even splendour,
of the religious services were maintained by their
skilful arrangement; painting, sculpture and architecture
were made familiar through their efforts,
and the best examples of these civilising arts were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>furnished by their churches and monasteries: it is
probable that their lands in general supplied the
best specimens of cultivation, and that the leisure
of the cloister was often bestowed in acquiring the
art of healing, so valuable in a rude state of society,
liable to many ills which our more fortunate period
could, with ordinary care, escape<a id='r924' /><a href='#f924' class='c012'><sup>[924]</sup></a>. Their manuscripts
yet attract our attention by the exquisite
beauty of the execution; they were often skilled in
music, and other pursuits which at once delight
and humanise us. To them alone could resort be
had for even the little instruction which the noble
and wealthy coveted: they were the only schoolmasters<a id='r925' /><a href='#f925' class='c012'><sup>[925]</sup></a>;
and those who yet preserve the affectionate
regard which grows up between a generous
boy and him to whom he owed his earliest intellectual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>training, can judge with what force such motives
acted in a state of society so different from
our own. Moreover the intervention of the clergy
in many most important affairs of life was almost
incessant. Marriage—that most solemn of all the
obligations which the man and the citizen can
contract—was celebrated under their superintendence:
without the instruments which they prepared
no secure transfer of property could be made; and
as arbitrators or advisers, they were resorted to for
the settlement of disputed right, and the avoidance
of dangerous litigation. Lastly, although during
the Anglosaxon period we nowhere find them putting
forward that shocking claim to consideration
which afterwards became so common—the being
makers of their Creator in the sacrament of the
Eucharist,—we cannot doubt that their calling was
supposed to confer a peculiar holiness upon them;
or that the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>hád</i></span>, the orders, they received, were
taken to remove them from the class of common
Christians into a higher and more sacred sphere.</p>

<p class='c001'>Great privileges were accordingly given to them
in a social point of view. They enjoyed a high
wergyld, an increased mundbyrd, and a distinguished
secular rank. The weofodþegn or servant
of the altar who duly performed his important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>functions, was reckoned on the same footing as
the secular thane, woroldþegn, who earned nobility
and wealth in the service of an earthly master.
The oaths of a priest or deacon were of more force
than those of a free man; and it was rendered
easier for them to rebut accusations by the aid of
their clerical compurgators, than for the simple
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ceorl</span> or even <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þegn</span>, and his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gegyldan</span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was nevertheless a wise provision that their
privileges should not extend so far as to remove
them entirely from participation in the general
interests of their countrymen, or make them aliens
from the obligations which the Anglosaxon state
imposed upon all its members. Personal privileges
they enjoyed, like other distinguished members
of the body politic, as long as their conduct
individually was such as to merit them; but they
were not cut off entirely from the common burthens
or the common advantages: and this will not unsatisfactorily
explain the immunity which England
long enjoyed, from struggles by which other European
states—and in later periods even our own—were
convulsed to their foundations. In their
cathedrals and conventual churches, or scattered
through the parishes over all the surface of the
land, but sharing in the interests of all classes,
they acted as a body of mediators between the
strong and the weak, repressing the violent, consoling
and upholding the sufferer, and offering even
to the despairing serf the hope of a future rest
from misery and subjection.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the first establishment of conventual bodies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>we have seen that a complete immunity had been
granted from the secular services to which all other
lands were liable<a id='r926' /><a href='#f926' class='c012'><sup>[926]</sup></a>; but that the inconvenience of
this course soon led to its abandonment. It is difficult
to say whether this immunity was at any time
extended to the hide, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mansus aecclesiasticus,</span>” or
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dos aecclesiae</span>” of the parish-church: it is on the
contrary probable that it never was so extended;
for no hint of the sort occurs in our own annals
or charters; and it is well known that the church
lands among the neighbouring Franks were subject,
like those of the laity, to the burthens of the state<a id='r927' /><a href='#f927' class='c012'><sup>[927]</sup></a>.
From every hide which passed into clerical hands,
the king could to the very last demand the <em>inevitable</em>
dues, military service, repairs of roads and
fortifications; and though it is not likely that the
parish priest was called upon to serve in person, it
is also not likely that he was excused the payment
of his quota toward the arming and support of a
substitute in the field<a id='r928' /><a href='#f928' class='c012'><sup>[928]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor did the legislation of the Teutonic nations
contemplate the withdrawal of the clergy from the
authority of the secular tribunals. The sin of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>clergyman might indeed be punished in the proper
manner by his ecclesiastical superior: penance and
censure might be inflicted by the bishop upon his
delinquent brother; but the crime of the citizen
was reserved for the cognizance of the state<a id='r929' /><a href='#f929' class='c012'><sup>[929]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This had been the custom of the Franks, even
while they permitted the clergy, who belonged to
the class of Roman provincials, to be judged by
the Roman law<a id='r930' /><a href='#f930' class='c012'><sup>[930]</sup></a>: it was for centuries the practice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>in England, and would probably so have remained
had the error of the Conqueror in separating the
civil and ecclesiastical jurisdictions not prepared
the way for the troublous times of the Henries
and Edwards. In the case of manslaughter, Ælfred
commands that the priest shall be secularised before
he is delivered for punishment to the ordinary
tribunals<a id='r931' /><a href='#f931' class='c012'><sup>[931]</sup></a>: Æðelred<a id='r932' /><a href='#f932' class='c012'><sup>[932]</sup></a> and Cnut<a id='r933' /><a href='#f933' class='c012'><sup>[933]</sup></a> decree that he is
to be secularised, to become an outlaw and abjure
the realm, and do such penance as the Pope shall
prescribe; and they extend this penalty to other
grievous offences besides homicide. Eádweard the
elder enacts that if a man in orders steal, fight,
perjure himself or be unchaste, he shall be subject to
the same penalties as the laity under the same circumstances
would be, and to his canonical penance
besides<a id='r934' /><a href='#f934' class='c012'><sup>[934]</sup></a>. But the plainest evidence that the clergy,
even including the most dignified of their body,
were held to answer before the ordinary courts, is
supplied by the many provisions in the laws as to
the mode of conducting their trials<a id='r935' /><a href='#f935' class='c012'><sup>[935]</sup></a>. It could not
indeed be otherwise in a country where every offence
was to be tried by the people themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>But the most effectual mode of separating the
clergy from the other members of the church yet
remains to be considered. He that is permitted to
contract marriage, to enjoy the inestimable blessings
of a home, to connect himself with a family,
and give the state dear pledges of his allegiance,
can never cease to be a citizen of that polity in
which his lot is cast. He can be no alien, no machine
to be put in motion by foreign force. Accordingly,
although the celibacy of the clergy is a
mere point of discipline (and could therefore be
dispensed with at once were it desired<a id='r936' /><a href='#f936' class='c012'><sup>[936]</sup></a>), it has
always been pertinaciously insisted upon by those
whose interest it was to destroy the national feeling
of the clergy in every country, and render them
subservient to one centralising power. It is fitting
that we enquire how far this was attempted in England,
and how far the attempt succeeded.</p>

<p class='c001'>The perilous position of the early Christians, and
especially of the clergy, rendered it at least matter
of prudence that they should not contract the obligation
of family bonds which must prove a serious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>hindrance to the performance of their duties. It
is therefore easily conceivable that marriage should
in the first centuries have been discouraged among
the members of this particular class. There was
also a tendency among the eastern Christians to engraft
upon the doctrines of the faith, those peculiar
metaphysical notions which seem always to have
characterized the oriental modes of thought. The
antagonism of spirit and matter, the degraded—nay
even diabolical<a id='r937' /><a href='#f937' class='c012'><sup>[937]</sup></a>—nature of the latter, and the
duty of emancipating the spiritual portion of our
being from its trammels, were quite as prominent
doctrines of some Christian communities, as of the
Brahman or Buddhist. The holiness of the priest
would, it was thought, be contaminated by his
union with a wife; and thus from a combination
of circumstances which in themselves had no necessary
connexion, an opinion came to prevail that
a state of celibacy was the proper one for the ministers
of the sacraments. It was at first recommended,
and then commanded, that those who wished
to devote themselves to the especial service of the
church, should not contract the bond of marriage.
Even the married citizen who accepted orders was
admonished to separate himself from the society of
his wife: and both were taught that a life of continence
for the future would be an acceptable offering
in the sight of God. It seems unnecessary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>dilate upon the fallacy of these views, or to point
out the gross and degrading materialism on which
they are ultimately based. The historian, while he
laments, must to the best of his power record the
aberrations of human intelligence, under his inevitable
conditions of place and time.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is uncertain at what period this restriction
was first attempted to be enforced in the Western
Church, but there are early councils which notice
the existence of a strong feeling on the subject<a id='r938' /><a href='#f938' class='c012'><sup>[938]</sup></a>.
In the year 376 a Gallic synod excommunicated
those who should refuse the ministrations of a
priest on the ground of his marriage<a id='r939' /><a href='#f939' class='c012'><sup>[939]</sup></a>. But this
can only prove that at the time there were married
priests, whether living in continence or not, and
that certain persons were scandalized at them. I
cannot admit, as some authors have done, that the
Council intended to make such marriages legal;
on the contrary, it seems to me that the intention
of the canon is merely to assert the validity
of the sacraments, however unworthy might
be the person by whom they were administered<a id='r940' /><a href='#f940' class='c012'><sup>[940]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>But restrictions which wound the natural feelings
of men are vain: popes and councils may decree,
but they cannot enforce obedience, and it seems to
me that on this particular subject they never entirely
succeeded in carrying out their views. All
they did was to convert a holy and a blessed connexion
into one of much lower character, and to
throw the doors wide open to immorality and
scandal. The efforts of Boniface in Germany were
particularly directed to this point<a id='r941' /><a href='#f941' class='c012'><sup>[941]</sup></a>, and his biographer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>tells us on more than one occasion of his success
in destroying the influence of married priests.
But it may be questioned whether the same result
attended the efforts of the Roman missionaries in
England. It seems to me, on the contrary, that we
have an almost unbroken chain of evidence to show
that, in spite of the exhortations of the bishops,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>and the legislation of the witan, those at least of
the clergy who were not bound to c&oelig;nobitical
order, did contract marriage, and openly rear the
families which were its issue. From Eddius we
learn that Wilfrið bishop of York, one of the
staunchest supporters of Romish views, had a son<a id='r942' /><a href='#f942' class='c012'><sup>[942]</sup></a>;
he does not indeed say that this son was born in
wedlock, nor does any author directly mention
Wilfrið’s marriage: but we may adopt this view of
the matter, as the less scandalous of two alternatives,
and as rendered probable by the absence of
all accusations which might have been brought
against the bishop on this score by any one of his
numerous enemies. In a charter of emancipation
we find among the witnesses, Ælfsige the priest
and his son<a id='r943' /><a href='#f943' class='c012'><sup>[943]</sup></a>: by another document a lady grants
a church hereditarily to Wulfmǽr the priest and
his offspring, as long as he shall have any in
orders<a id='r944' /><a href='#f944' class='c012'><sup>[944]</sup></a>, where a succession of married clergymen
is obviously contemplated. Again we read of Godwine
at Worðig bishop Ælfsige’s son<a id='r945' /><a href='#f945' class='c012'><sup>[945]</sup></a>, and of the
son of Oswald a presbyter<a id='r946' /><a href='#f946' class='c012'><sup>[946]</sup></a>. Under Eádweard the
Confessor we are told of Robert the deacon and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>son-in-law Richard Fitzscrob<a id='r947' /><a href='#f947' class='c012'><sup>[947]</sup></a>, and of Gódríc a son
of the king’s chaplain Gódman<a id='r948' /><a href='#f948' class='c012'><sup>[948]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may no doubt be argued that in some of these
instances the children may have been the issue of
marriages contracted before the father entered into
orders; but it is obvious that this was not the case
with all of them, nor is there any proof that any
were so. On the other hand we have evidence of
married priests which it would be difficult to reject.
Florence speaks of the newly born son of a certain
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>presbytera</i></span>, or priest’s wife<a id='r949' /><a href='#f949' class='c012'><sup>[949]</sup></a>: I have already cited
a passage from Simeon of Durham which distinctly
mentions a married presbyter<a id='r950' /><a href='#f950' class='c012'><sup>[950]</sup></a>, about the year
1045: and the History of Ely records the wife and
family of an archipresbyter in that town<a id='r951' /><a href='#f951' class='c012'><sup>[951]</sup></a>. Lastly
we are told over and over again that one principal
cause for the removal of the canons or prebendaries
from the cathedrals and collegiate churches by
Æðelwold and Oswald was the contravention of
their rule by marriage.</p>

<p class='c001'>The frequent allusion to this subject by the kings
in various enactments, serve to show very clearly
that the clergy would not submit to the restraint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>attempted to be enforced upon them. But we have
a still more conclusive evidence in the words of an
episcopal charge delivered by archbishop Ælfric.
He says, “Beloved, we cannot now compel you by
force to observe chastity, but we admonish you to
observe it, as the ministers of Christ ought, and as
did those holy men whom we have already mentioned,
and who spent all their lives in chastity<a id='r952' /><a href='#f952' class='c012'><sup>[952]</sup></a>.”
It is thus very clear that the clergy paid little regard
to such admonishments, unsupported by secular
penalties. In this, as perhaps in some other
cases, the good sense and sound feeling of the nation
struggled successfully against the authority of
the Papal See. In fact, though spirituality were the
pretext, a most abominable slavery to materialism
lies at the root of all the grounds on which the
Roman prelates founded the justification of their
course. That they had ulterior objects in view
may easily be surmised, though these may have
been but dimly described and hesitatingly confessed,
until Gregory the Seventh boldly and openly
avowed them. Had the Roman church ventured
to argue that the clergy ought to be separated entirely
from the nation and the state, nay from
humanity itself, for certain definite purposes and
ends, it would at least have deserved the praise of
candour; and much might have been alleged in favour
of this view while the clergy were still strictly
missionaries exposed to the perils and uncertainties
of a daily struggle. But, in an absurd idolatry of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>what was miscalled chastity, to proscribe the noblest
condition and some of the highest functions
of man, was to set up a rule essentially false, and
literally hold out a premium to immorality; and so
the more reflecting even of the clergy themselves
admitted<a id='r953' /><a href='#f953' class='c012'><sup>[953]</sup></a>. Whatever may have been the desire of
the prelates, we may be certain that not only in
England, but generally throughout the North of
Europe, the clergy did enter into quasi-marriages;
and as late as the thirteenth century, the priests in
Norway replied to Gregory the Ninth by setting
up the fact of uninterrupted custom<a id='r954' /><a href='#f954' class='c012'><sup>[954]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>In addition to the clergy who either in their conventual
or parochial churches administered the rites
of religion to their flocks, very considerable monastic
establishments existed from an early period
in England. It is true that not every church which
our historians call <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>monasterium</i></span> was really a monastic
foundation, but many of them undoubtedly
were so; and it is likely that they supplied no
small number of presbyters and bishops to the service
of the church. The rule of St. Benedict was
well established throughout the West long before
Augustine set foot in Britain; and although monks
are not necessarily clergymen, it is probable that
many of the body in this country took holy orders.
Like the clergy the monks were subject to the control
of the bishop, and the abbots received consecration
from the diocesan. Till a late period in
fact, there is little reason to suppose that any
English monastery succeeded in obtaining exemption
from episcopal visitation: though on the other
hand it is probable that monasteries founded by
powerful and wealthy laymen did contrive practically
to establish a considerable independence. This
is the more conceivable, because we cannot doubt
that a great difference did from the first exist between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>the rules adopted by various congregations
of monks, or imposed upon them by their patrons
and founders, until the time when greater familiarity
with Benedict’s regulations, and the customs
of celebrated houses, produced a more general
conformity.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the most disputed questions in Anglosaxon
history is that touching the revival of
monkery by Dúnstán and his partizans. Its supposed
connexion with the tragical story of Eádwig,
and the dismemberment of England by Eádgár,
have lent it some of the attractions of romance; and
by the monastic chroniclers in general, it has very
naturally been looked upon as the greatest point in
the progressive record of our institutions. Connected
as it is with some of the most violent prejudices
of our nature, political, professional and
personal, it has not only obtained a large share of
attention from ecclesiastical historians of all ages,
but has been discussed with great eagerness, not to
say acrimony, by those who differed in opinion as
to the wisdom and justice of the revival itself. Yet
it does not appear to me to have been brought to
the degree of clearness which we should have expected
from the skill and learning of those who
have undertaken its elucidation. Neither the share
which Dúnstán took in the great revolution, nor
the extent to which Æðelwold and Oswald succeeded
in their plans, are yet satisfactorily settled;
and great obscurity still hangs both over the manner
and the effect of the change.</p>

<p class='c001'>Few things in history, when carefully investigated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>do really prove to have been done in a hurry.
Sudden revolutions are much less common than we
are apt to suppose, and fewer links than we imagine
are wanting in the great chain of causes and
effects. Could we place ourselves above the exaggerations
of partizans, who hold it a point of honour
to prove certain events to be indiscriminately right
or indiscriminately wrong, we should probably find
that the course of human affairs had been one
steady and very gradual progression; the reputation
of individual men would perhaps be shorn of
part of its lustre; and though we should lose some
of the satisfaction of hero-worship, we might more
readily admit the constant action of a superintending
providence, operating without caprice through
very common and every-day channels. But it
would have been too much to expect an impartial
account of the events which led to the reformation
of the Benedictine order in England; like Luther
in the fifteenth, Dúnstán must be made the principal
figure in the picture of the tenth century:
throughout all great social struggles the protagonist
stalks before us in gigantic stature,—glorious as
an archangel, or terrible and hideous as Satan.</p>

<p class='c001'>The writers who arose shortly after the triumph
of the Reformation have revelled in this fruitful
theme. The abuses of monachism,—not entirely
forgotten at the beginning of the seventeenth century,—its
undeniable faults, and the mischief it
entails upon society,—judged with the exaggeration
which unhappily seems inseparable from religious
polemics, produced in every part of Europe a succession
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>of violent and headlong attacks upon the
institution and its patrons, which we can now more
readily understand than excuse. But just as little
can the calm, impartial judgment of the historian
ratify the indiscriminate praise which was lavished
by the Roman Catholics upon all whom the zeal of
Protestants condemned, the misrepresentations of
fact by which they attempted to fortify their opinions,
or the eager <a id='corr451.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='credulty'>credulity</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_451.9'><ins class='correction' title='credulty'>credulity</ins></a></span> which they showed
when any tale, however preposterous, appeared to
support their particular objects. In later times the
controversy has been renewed with greater decency
of language, but not less zeal. The champion of
protestantism is the Rev. Mr. Soames: Dr. Lingard
takes up the gauntlet on behalf of his church. It
is no intention of mine to balance their conflicting
views as to the character and intentions of Dúnstán
and his two celebrated coadjutors; these have been
too deeply tinged by the ground-colour that lies
beneath the outlines. But I propose to examine
the facts upon which both parties seem agreed,
though each may represent them variously in accordance
with a favourite theory.</p>

<p class='c001'>It admits of no doubt whatever that monachism,
and monachism under the rule of St. Benedict, had
been established at an early period in this country<a id='r955' /><a href='#f955' class='c012'><sup>[955]</sup></a>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>but it is equally certain that the strict rule had
very generally ceased to be maintained at the time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>when Dúnstán undertook its restoration. Many
of the conventual churches had never been connected
with monks at all; while among the various
abbeys which the piety or avarice of individuals had
founded, there were probably numerous instances
where no rule had ever prevailed, but the caprice
of the founders, who <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>iure dominii</i></span> imposed such regulations
as their vanity suggested, or their industry
gleaned from the established orders of Columba,
Benedict, and other credited authorities<a id='r956' /><a href='#f956' class='c012'><sup>[956]</sup></a>. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>chapters, whatever their origin, had in process of
time slid into that easy and serene state of secular
canons, which we can still contemplate in the venerable
precincts of cathedral closes. The celibacy
of the clergy had not been maintained: and even
in the collegiate churches the presbyter and prebendaries
had permitted themselves to take wives,
which could never have been contemplated even
by those who would have looked with indulgence
upon that connexion on the part of parish priests.
Moreover in many places, wealthy ease, power, a
dignified and somewhat irresponsible position had
produced their natural effect upon the canons,
some of whom were connected with the best families
of the state; so that, in spite of all the deductions
which must be made for exaggeration on the
part of the monkish writers, we cannot deny that
many instances of profligacy and worldly-mindedness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>did very probably disgrace the clerical profession.
It would be strange indeed if what has taken
place in every other age and country should have
been unexampled only among the Anglosaxons of
the ninth and tenth centuries, or that their monks
and clergy should have enjoyed a monopoly of
purity, holiness and devotion to duty<a id='r957' /><a href='#f957' class='c012'><sup>[957]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>As we have seen already, it was only towards
the end of the eighth century that Chrodogang
introduced a c&oelig;nobitical mode of life in the cathedral
of his archdiocese. Long before this time the
great majority of our churches had been founded;
and among them some may possibly from the first
have been served by clergymen resident in their
own detached houses, and who merely met at
stated hours to perform their duties in the choir,
living at other times apart upon their præbenda or
allowances from the general fund. But some of the
cathedrals had been founded in connexion with
abbeys; and it is probable that a majority of these
great establishments were provided with some Rule
of life, and demanded a c&oelig;nobitical though not
strictly monastic habit. This is too frequently alluded
to by the prelates of the seventh century, not
to be admitted. But whatever may have been the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>details in different establishments, we may be certain
that residence, temperance, soberness, chastity,
and a strict attendance upon the divine services
were required by the Rule of every society.
Unfortunately these are restrictions and duties
which experience proves to have been sometimes
neglected; nor can we find any great improbability
in the assertion of the Saxon Chronicle, that the
canons of Winchester would hold no rule at all<a id='r958' /><a href='#f958' class='c012'><sup>[958]</sup></a>;
or in the accusations brought against them in the
Annals of Winchester<a id='r959' /><a href='#f959' class='c012'><sup>[959]</sup></a>, and in Wulfstán’s Life of
Æðelwold<a id='r960' /><a href='#f960' class='c012'><sup>[960]</sup></a>, of violating every one of their obligations.
I do not see any reason to doubt the justice
of the charge made against some of their body by
the last-named author, of having deserted the wives
they had taken, and living in open and scandalous
disregard of morality as well as canonical restraint.
Wulfstán very likely made the most of his facts,
but it is to be remembered that he was an eye-witness;
and it is improbable that he should have
been indebted exclusively to his invention for
charges so boldly made, so capable of being readily
brought to the test, and containing in truth nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>repugnant to our experience of human nature. The
canons of Winchester, many of whom were highly
connected, wealthy beyond those of most other
foundations, and established in the immediate vicinity
of the royal court, may possibly have been
more than ordinarily neglectful of their duties<a id='r961' /><a href='#f961' class='c012'><sup>[961]</sup></a>;
and they do appear in fact to have been treated in
a much more summary way than the prebendaries
of other cathedrals; yet perhaps not with strict
justice, unless it can be shown that Winchester was
ever a monastic establishment, which, previous to
Æðelwold, I do not remember it to have been.
Lingard who would have gratefully accepted any
evidence against the canons in the other cathedrals,
confines himself to Winchester; yet it strikes one
as some confirmation of the general charge, even
against their brethren at Worcester, that among
the signatures to their charters so few are those of
deacons and presbyters, till long after Oswald’s
appointment to the see. This, although the silence
of their adversaries allows us to acquit them of the
irregularities laid to the charge of the canons at
Winchester, may lead us to infer that they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>not scrupulously diligent in fulfilling the duties of
their calling.</p>

<p class='c001'>We cannot feel the least surprise that Dúnstán
desired to reform the state of the church. The
peculiar circumstances of his early years, even the
severe mental struggles which preceded and explain
his adoption of the monastic career, were eminently
calculated to train him for a <em>Reviver</em>; and Revival
was the fashion of his day. Arnold earl of Flanders<a id='r962' /><a href='#f962' class='c012'><sup>[962]</sup></a>
had lent himself with the utmost zeal to the
reform of the Benedictine abbeys in his territory,
and they were the models selected for imitation, or
as schools of instruction, by other lands, especially
England so closely connected with Flanders by
commerce and the alliances of the reigning houses<a id='r963' /><a href='#f963' class='c012'><sup>[963]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>Yet with it all, Dúnstán does not appear to have
taken a very prominent part in the proceedings of
the friends of monachism,—certainly not the prominent
part taken by Oswald or Æðelwold, the
last of whom merited the title of the “Father of
Monks,” by the attention he paid to their interests.
In the archbishop’s own cathedral at Canterbury,
the canons were left in undisturbed possession of
their property and dignity, nor were monks introduced
there by archbishop Ælfríc till some years
after Dúnstán’s death. And even this measure,
although supported by papal authority<a id='r964' /><a href='#f964' class='c012'><sup>[964]</sup></a>, was not
final: it was only in the time of Lanfranc that the
monks obtained secure possession of Christchurch.
Dúnstán very probably continued throughout his
life to be a favourer of the Order, and merited its
gratitude by giving it valuable countenance and
substantial protection against violence. But he was
assuredly not himself a violent disturber, casting
all things divine and human into confusion for
the sake of a system of monkery. His recorded
conduct shows nothing of the kind. I believe
his monkish and very vulgar-minded panegyrists
to have done his character and memory great
wrong in this respect; and that they have measured
the distinguished statesman by the narrow
gauge of their own intelligence and desire. Troublous
no doubt were his commencements; and in
the days of his misery, while his mind yet tossed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>and struggled among the awful abysses of an unfathomed
sea in the fierce conflicts of his ascetic
retirement, where the broken heart sought rest
and found it not, he may have given credence himself
to what he considered supernatural visitations
vouchsafed, and powers committed, to him. But
when time had somewhat healed his wounds, when
the first difficulties of his political life were surmounted,
and he ruled England,—nominally as the
minister of Eádgár, really as the leader of a very
powerful party among the aristocracy,—there can
be little doubt that the spirit of compromise, which
always has been the secret of our public life, produced
its necessary effect upon himself. Dúnstán
was neither Richelieu nor Mazarin, but the servant
of a king who wielded very limited powers; he had
first attained his throne through a revolt, the pretext
for which was his brother’s bad government,
and its justification,—the consequent right of the
people to depose him. Whatever may have been
the archbishop’s private leaning, he appears to
have conducted himself with great discretion, and
to have very skilfully maintained the peace between
the two embittered factions; he perhaps
encouraged Eádgár to manifest his partiality for
monachism by the construction or reform of abbeys;
he probably supported Oswald and Æðelwold by
his advice, and by preventing them from being
illegally interfered with in the course of their lawful
actions; but as prime minister of England, he
maintained the peace as well for one as for the
other, and there is no evidence that any measure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>of violence or spoliation took place by his connivance
or consent. Neither the nation, nor the
noble families whose scions found a comfortable
provision and sufficient support in the prebends,
would have looked calmly upon the unprovoked
destruction of rights sanctioned by prescription.
But there is indeed no reason to believe that violent
measures were resorted to in any of the establishments,
to bring about the changes desired.
Even in Winchester, where more compulsion seems
to have been used than anywhere else, the evicted
canons were provided with pensions. I strongly
suspect that in fact they did retain during their
lives the prebends which could not legally be taken
from them, though they might be expelled from
the cathedral service and the collegiate buildings;
and that this is what the monkish writers veil
under the report that pensions were assigned
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Lingard has very justly observed that Oswald,
with all his zeal, made no change whatever
in his cathedral of York, which archdiocese he at
one time held together with Worcester; and that,
generally speaking, the new monasteries were either
reared upon perfectly new ground, or on ancient
foundations then entirely reduced to ruins<a id='r965' /><a href='#f965' class='c012'><sup>[965]</sup></a>. With
regard to Worcester, he says:—“Of Oswald we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>are told that he introduced monks in the place
of clergymen into seven churches within his bishopric;
but there is reason to believe that some
of the seven were new foundations, and that in
some of the others the change was effected with
the full consent of the canons themselves. In his
cathedral he succeeded by the following artifice.
Having erected in its vicinity a new church to the
honour of the Virgin Mary, he entrusted it to the
care of a community of monks, and frequented it
himself for the solemn celebration of mass. The
presence of the bishop attracted that of the people;
the ancient clergy saw their church gradually
abandoned; and after some delay, Wensine, their
dean, a man advanced in years and of unblemished
character, took the monastic habit, and was advanced
three years later to the office of prior. The
influence of his example and the honour of his
promotion, held out a strong temptation to his
brethren; till at last the number of canons was so
diminished by repeated desertions, that the most
wealthy of the churches of Mercia became without
dispute or violence, by the very act of its old possessors,
a monastery of Benedictine monks<a id='r966' /><a href='#f966' class='c012'><sup>[966]</sup></a>. In
what manner Oswald proceeded with the other
churches we are ignorant; but in 971 he became
archbishop of York, and though he held that high
dignity during twenty years, we do not read that
he introduced a single colony of monks or changed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>the constitution of a single clerical establishment,
within the diocese. The reason is unknown.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It might not unfairly be suggested either that
the rights of the canons were too well established
to be shaken, or that experience had changed his
own mind as to the necessity of the alteration.
High station, active engagement with the details
of business, increasing age, and a natural mutual
respect which grows with better acquaintance, may
have convinced Oswald that his youthful zeal had
a little outrun discretion, and that the canons in
his province and diocese were not so utterly devoid
of claims to consideration as he once had imagined
in his reforming fervour. But the reader of Anglosaxon
history will not fail to have observed that
the measured and in general fair tone of Dr. Lingard
differs very widely from that of early monkish
chroniclers, and that he himself attributes to Oswald
a much less active interference than is asserted
by many protestant historians. That he is
right I do not for a moment doubt; for not only
are the accounts of Oswald’s biographers inconsistent
with one another, and improbable, but we
have very strong evidence that the eviction of the
canons from Worcester was not completed in Oswald’s
lifetime. We possess no fewer than seventy-eight
charters granted by his chapter, and these
comprise several signed in 990 and 991, the years
immediately preceding that in which he died<a id='r967' /><a href='#f967' class='c012'><sup>[967]</sup></a>:
these charters are signed in part by presbyters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>and deacons, in part by clerics, and there is but
one signature of a monk<a id='r968' /><a href='#f968' class='c012'><sup>[968]</sup></a>, though there are at
least six <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>clerici</i></span> who subscribe. Although from an
examination of the charters I entertain no doubt
that several, if not all, the presbyters and deacons
were monks, still it is clear that a number of the
canons still retained their influence over the property
of the chapter till within a few months of
Oswald’s decease. This prelate came to his see in
960, and according to many accounts immediately
replaced the canons of Worcester by monks: all
agree that he lost no time about it, and Florence<a id='r969' /><a href='#f969' class='c012'><sup>[969]</sup></a>,
himself a monk of that place, fixes his
triumph in the year 969. Consistently with this
we have a grant of that year<a id='r970' /><a href='#f970' class='c012'><sup>[970]</sup></a>, in which Wynsige
the monk, and all the monks at Worcester are
named: we have a similar statement<a id='r971' /><a href='#f971' class='c012'><sup>[971]</sup></a> in another
document of 974: and in subsequent charters
monks are named. A good example occurs in a
grant of the year 977, to which are appended the
names of eight monks<a id='r972' /><a href='#f972' class='c012'><sup>[972]</sup></a>: but coupled with these
are also the names of sixteen clerics, exclusive of
a presbyter and deacon of old standing, whom the
chapter had probably caused to be ordained long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>before, to do the service for them. All at once the
addition <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>monachus</i></span> to seven of these eight names
vanishes, and is replaced by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>presbyter</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>diaconus</i></span>.
Henceforth the number of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>clerici</i></span> gradually diminishes,
but, as we have seen, is not entirely gone
in 991, the year before Oswald’s death. I do not
believe that the bishop had any power to expel the
canons, and that he was compelled to let them
remain where they were until they died: but he
perhaps could prevent any but monks from being
received in their places, and it is to be presumed
that he could refuse to admit any but monks to
priests’ and deacons’ orders. This, we may gather
from the charters, was the plan he pursued; and
when we consider the dignity and power possessed
by the Anglosaxon priesthood, we shall confess that
it was one which threw every advantage into the
scale of monachism.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had we similar means of enquiry, it is very probable
that we should come to the same conclusion
with regard to other establishments from which
the canons are said to have been forcibly driven.
However enough seems to have been said, to
prove that we must be very careful how we trust to
the random assertions of partizans either on one
side or the other. Let us be ready to condemn
ecclesiastical tyranny and arrogance, wherever it is
proved to have disgraced the clerical profession;
but let us not forget that it is our duty to judge
charitably. In the case which we have now considered,
I think we shall be disposed to acquit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>some men, whose names fill a conspicuous place
in Saxon history, of the violence and folly which
their own over-zealous partizans have laid to their
charge, and which have been used in modern times
to embitter the separation unfortunately existing
between two great bodies of Christians.</p>

contemplated the marriage and separate dwelling of these persons.
But for a long time it is improbable that any such arrangement could
take place. Augustine separated his monks from the canons who had
accompanied him (the presbyters he was to obtain in the neighbouring
countries of Gaul: see Gregory’s Epistles to Theodoric and Theodbert,
and to Brunhild; Bed. Op. Min. ii. 234, 235), placing the latter in
Christchurch, Canterbury. See Lingard, Ang. Sax. Church, i. 152, 153.

etc. Beda, Vit. Cuthb. c. 29. This however is perhaps rather to be
considered as an episcopal visitation. But there is abundant evidence
that at first the custom was such as the text describes. It is said thus
of Aidan, the Scottish bishop in Northumberland: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erat in villa regia
non longe ab urbe de qua praefati sumus</span> [i. e. Bamborough]. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In hac

H. E. iii. 17. This was a small wooden church, and certainty never a
cathedral. But the early custom of the Scottish church in Northumberland
is further described by Beda: and one can only lament that it
was not much longer maintained: for his own words show that he is
contrasting it with the custom of his own times, nearly a century later;
he says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quantae autem parsimoniae, cuiusque continentiae fuerit
ipse [i. e. Colman] cum praedecessoribus suis, testabatur etiam locus
ille quem regebant, ubi abeuntibus eis, excepta aecclesia, paucissimae
domus repertae sunt; hoc est, illae solummodo, sine quibus conversatio
civilis esse nullatenus poterat. Nil pecuniarum absque pecoribus habebant.
Si quid enim pecuniae a divitibus accipiebant, mox pauperibus
dabant. Nam neque ad susceptionem potentium saeculi, vel pecunias
colligi vel domus praevideri necesse fuit, qui nunquam ad aecclesiam
nisi orationis tantum, et audiendi verbi Dei causa veniebant....
Tota enim fuit tunc solicitudo doctoribus illis Deo serviendi, non saeculo;
tota cura cordis excolendi non ventris. Unde et in magna erat
veneratione tempore illo religionis habitus; ita ut ubicunque clericus
aliquis aut monachus adveniret, gaudentur ab omnibus tanquam Dei
famulus exciperetur: etiam si in itinere pergens inveniretur, adcurrebant,
et flexa cervice vel manu signari, vel ore illius se benedici gaudebant;
verbis quoque horum exhortatoriis diligenter auditum praebebant.
Set et diebus Dominicis ad aecclesiam, sive ad monasteria certatim,
non reficiendi corporis, sed audiendi sermonis Dei gratia confluebant:
et si quis sacerdotum in vicum forte deveniret, mox congregati
in unum vicani, verbum vitae ab illo expetere curabant. Nam neque alia
ipsis sacerdotibus aut clericis vicos adeundi, quam praedicandi, baptizandi,
infirmos visitandi, et, ut breviter dicam, animas curandi causa
fuit: qui in tantum erant ab omni avaritiae peste castigati, ut nemo

York, he was accustomed, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">oppida, rura, casas, vicos, castella, propter
evangelizandum, non equitando, sed apostolorum more pedibus incedendo
peragrare.</span>” Ibid. iii. 21. About the same period we learn from
Beda, that Cuthbert used to make circuits for the purpose of preaching:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erat quippe moris <em>eo tempore</em> populis Anglorum, ut veniente in
villam clerico vel presbytero, cuncti ad eius imperium verbum audituri
confluerent.</span>” Ibid. iv. 27. The words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>eo tempore</i></span> also show that in
Beda’s time this custom was no longer observed, which is naturally explained
by the existence of parish-churches. The custom of itinerant
preachers in the west of England is also noted about the same period,
viz. 680. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum vero aliqui, sicut illis regionibus moris est, praesbyteri

nevertheless at first not the full privileges of parish-churches. The
twenty-first canon of the Council of Agda decreed: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si quis etiam extra

there were at this period parish-churches in Gaul, served by a single
presbyter, appears from other decisions usually attributed to this council,
but really published by the Council of Albon, held eleven years
later. They are in fact not found in the three oldest MSS. of the Concilium
Agathense. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diacones vel presbyteri in parochia constituti de

regulation was made in England as to the payment of tithe by a landowner
who happened to have a church with a churchyard upon his
estate. “If there be any thane who has a church with a churchyard
upon his bookland, let him give the third part of his tithe to his church.
But if any one have a church that has no churchyard, let him give his
priest what he will out of the nine parts,”—that is out of what remains
after the payment of his tithe to the cathedral church. Eádg. i. § 2.
Thorpe, i. 262. Probably there were many such churches in existence,
which had descended together with the estates from the first founders,
and whose owners could not agree with the ecclesiastical authorities as
to their liabilities. The right of patronage was abused unfortunately at
a very early period, both by clerics and laymen, as we learn abundantly
from the decrees of the several provincial councils.</p>

The tenth chapter of Hludwich’s capitulary is drawn up in the same

Osuuald, magna devotione verbum fidei praedicare, et credentibus gratiam

Construebantur ergo aecclesiae per loca, confluebant ad audiendum verbum
populi gaudentes, donabantur munere regis possessiones, et territoria
ad instituenda monasteria.</span>” Hist. Eccl. iii. 3. Again in Essex,
between 650 and 660: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui, [i. e. Ced] accepto gradu episcopatus,
rediit ad provinciam, et maiori auctoritate caeptum opus explens, fecit per

quorum prior locus est in ripa Pentae amnis, secundus in ripa Tamensis;
in quibus collecto examine famulorum Christi, disciplinam vitae

Hist. Eccl. iii. 22. About 690, Beda says of Cúðberht, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plures per

iv. 28. And it is difficult to understand the passage about to be cited
of anything but heathen temples in the marks, which the zeal of the
bishop of Mercia, Gearoman, converted into Christian churches, that is
separate parish-churches. A pestilence raged in Essex: one of its kings,
Sigheri, apostatized together with all his part of the people, “and set
about restoring their deserted temples, and adoring images.” To correct
this error, Wulfheri of Mercia, the superior king, sent his bishop
Gearoman: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui multa agens solertia ... longe lateque omnia pervagatus,
et populum et regem praefatum ad viam iustitiae reduxit: adeo
ut relictis, sive destructis fanis arisque quas fecerant, aperirent aecclesias,

a cathedral. When Liutgar and his companions landed on the
little island of Helgoland, they destroyed the heathen temples and
built Christian churches. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pervenientes autem ad eandem insulam,

of the heathen fanes. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Simul et reliquias beatorum apostolorum ac

the state generally into that condition which would have existed had
the church and the empire not been on terms of hostility when the
church first was founded. Had the heathen creed not stood in the way,
from the very first it is probable that the praefect of the city and the
mayor of the village would have been universally also the Episcopus
and Chorepiscopus of the community: but the χάρισμα κυβερνησέως
and χάρισμα διδασκαλίας would not then have united in the same hands.
The church assumed form and shape under pressure, and passed from
a molluscous into a vertebrated organization through its struggles to
resist persecution on the one hand and heresy on the other. When it
entered into its alliance with the state its outward constitution was
already completed. That alliance is not a metaphysical entity, but an
historical fact.</p>

<p class='c001'>The count (in England Ealdorman) and bishop are on one line, and,
if we may anticipate a little for the sake of illustration, we may add the
Eorl of Cnut’s constitution on the one side, and the Metropolitan on
the other. The Missus of the count and the chorepiscopus (in Strabo’s
time yet existing, though less important than his city brother) are on
the second line; nevertheless the Missus partakes of the comitial dignity,
and the episcopal, though grudgingly, is still vouchsafed to the
chorepiscopus. Next in rank is the Centenarius or president of the
Hundred, the officer of the pagus: his equivalent is the priest in a
church where baptism is performed, the peculiar distinctive of a parish-church.
The Decurio or Decanus is on the same footing as the German
Capellanus or Kaplan, who is indeed ordained to a title, but not with
power to administer the sacraments. The Kaplan is in truth generally
attached to the parish-church—a sort of curate,—and often succeeds
to it. But how is it that the parallel can be carried no further? Is it
that the Deacon’s ordination was not conclusive enough? Or were
Collectarii and Duumviri, beadles, tax-gatherers and bailiffs not dignified
enough to compare with even acolytes and vergers?</p>

occurs to me in the case of Leopold, duke of Austria, the captor of
Coeur de Lion, in 1195. A fall from his horse produced a compound
fracture of the leg, which from the treatment it received soon mortified.
Amputation was necessary, and it was performed by the duke himself,
<em>holding an axe to the limb, which his chamberlain struck with a beetle</em>.

least reflecting man. In the ninth century there was not a single copy
of the Old and New Testaments to be found in the whole diocese of
Lisieux. We learn this startling fact from a letter sent by Freculf,
its bishop, to Hrabanus Maurus. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ad haec vestrae charitatis vigilantia
intendat, quoniam nulla nobis librorum copia suppeditat, etiamsi

<div class='footnote' id='f929'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r929'>929</a>. The great argument of the clergy in later times,—in the twelfth
century particularly, when all over Europe the attempt was made to
exempt them from secular jurisdiction,—“that no one ought to be
punished twice for the same offence,” had apparently not yet been
thought of. The penances of the church, by which the sinner was to
be reconciled to God, were still held quite distinct from the sufferings
by which he expiated his violation of the law. Theodore alleviates, but
does not remit, the penance of those whose guilt has bent their heads
to human slavery. Theod. Poen. xvi. § 3. See this argument stated
in the quarrel between Henry II. and Becket: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In contrarium sentiebat
archiepiscopus, ut quos exauctorent episcopi a manu laicali postmodum
non punirentur, quia bis in idipsum puniri viderentur.</span>” Rog.
Wendov. an. 1164. vol. ii. 304. But this was a two-edged argument,
as its upholders soon found, when the laity on the same grounds
claimed exemption from secular punishment for offences committed
upon the persons of the clergy; justly urging, upon the premises, that
they were excommunicated for their acts, and ought not to be subject
to a second infliction. Accordingly in 1176, we find Richard archbishop
of Canterbury attempting to explain away what Becket had so
vigorously advanced: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nec dicatur quod aliquis bis puniatur propter
hoc in idipsum, nec enim iteratum est, quod ab uno incipitur et ab
altero consummatur,</span>” etc. See his letter to the bishops in An. Trivet.
1176. p. 82 <i>seq.</i> We shall readily admit that the laity ought not to
have been let loose upon the clergy; but upon the same grounds we
shall claim the subjection of the clergy to the secular tribunals for all
secular offences.</p>

environ this subject, may be doubted; but it cannot escape any one
who has enjoyed the intimacy of the more enlightened Roman Catholics,
whether cleric or laic, that a strong feeling exists in favour of a change.
In Bohemia and other Slavonic countries, yet in communion with Rome,
the celibacy of the clergy has ever been a stumbling-block and stone of
offence, and has done more than anything else to keep alive old Hussite
traditions. A few years ago so much danger was felt to lurk in the
question, that the Vienna censorship thought fit to suppress portions
of Palaczy’s History, which favoured the national views. Nor has
Germany, at almost any period, lacked thinkers who have vigorously
protested against a practice which they assert to have no foundation in
Holy Writ, and look upon as disastrous to the State.</p>

speaks in the following terms of the Council of Rome, celebrated by
Gregory the Seventh in 1074:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iste papa in synodo generali simoniacos
excommunicavit, uxoratos sacerdotes a divino removit officio, et
laicis missas eorum audire interdixit, novo exemplo et, ut multis visum
est, inconsiderato iudicio, contra sanctorum patrum sententiam, qui
scripserunt, quod sacramenta quae in aecclesia fiunt, baptisma, chrisma,
corpus Christi et sanguis, Spiritu invisibiliter cooperante, eorundem
sacramentorum effectum [habeant], seu per bonos, seu per malos intra
Dei aecclesiam dispensentur; tamen quia Spiritus Sanctus mystice illa
vivificat, nec bonorum meritis amplificantur, nec peccatis malorum
attenuantur. Ex qua re tam grave oritur scandalum, ut nullius haeresis
tempore sancta aecclesia graviori sit schismate discissa, his pro
iustitia, illis contra iustitiam agentibus; porro paucis continentiam observantibus:
aliquibus eam causa lucri ac iactantiae simulantibus,
multis incontinentiam periurio multipliciori adulterio cumulantibus:
ad haec, opportunitate laicis insurgentibus contra sacros ordines, et se
ab omni aecclesiastica subiectione excutientibus, laici sacra mysteria
temerant et de his disputant, infantes baptizant, sordido aurium
humore pro sacro chrismate utentes et oleo, in extremo vitae viaticum
Dominicum et usitatum aecclesiae obsequium sepulturae a presbyteris
uxoratis accipere parvipendunt; decimas etiam presbyteris debitas
igne cremant, corpus Domini a presbyteris uxoratis consecratum

terram effundunt.</span>” Wend. ii. 13. See the Acts of this Council in
Hardouin, vi. col. 1521 <i>seq.</i> In the following year, 1075, the abbot of

<p class='c001'><a href='#r941'>941</a>. Boniface appears to have been quite as earnest in the eighth as
Dunstan was in the tenth century. We are told of him in Thuringia,
that in accordance with the instructions of the Apostolical Pontiff,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">senatores plebis totiusque populi principes verbis spiritalibus affatus

doubt about its prudence. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoc autem bonum quibusdam visum est,

day in Ireland are well known, and the case is very similar in the
Roman Catholic part of Hungary. See Paget, Hungary and Transylvania,
i. 114. Shortly before the Reformation, the inconveniences
arising from this state of things were felt to be so intolerable, yet the
danger to society from a strict enforcement of the rule so great, that
in some parts of Europe the bishop licensed their priests so take concubines,
at a settled tariff, and further raised a sum upon each child
born. Erasmus relates that one bishop had admitted to him the issuing
of no less than twelve thousand such licenses in one year. In his diocese
the tax was probably light, the peasants sturdy, and the female population
more than ordinarily chaste. It was not unusual for the English
kings to compel the priests to redeem their <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>focariae</i></span> or concubines,
which amounts to much the same thing. This occurred in the years
1129 and 1208. See Wendover, ii. 210; iii. 223.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r955'>955</a>. Mr. Soames (Anglosax. Church, p. 179, third edit.) says that Dúnstán’s
monastery at Glastonbury was the first establishment of the kind
ever known in England, and Dúnstán the first of English Benedictine
abbots. Nothing can possibly be more inexact than this assertion.
Biscop’s foundation at Wearmouth was a Benedictine one. In an address
to his monks, he himself is represented to say:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ideo multum
cavetote, fratres, semper, ne secundum genus unquam, ne deforis aliunde
vobis Patrem quaeratis; sed iuxta quod Regula magni quondam abbatis
Benedicti, iuxta quod privilegii nostri continent decreta, in conventa
vestrae congregationis communi consilio perquiratis, qui secundum vitae
meritum et sapientiae doctrinam aptior ad tale ministerium perficiendum
digniorque probetur; et quemcunque omnes unanimae charitatis
inquisitione optimum cognoscentes eligeretis, hunc vobis, accito episcopo,
rogetis abbatem consueta benedictione formari.</span>” Beda, Vit.
Bened. § 12. (Opera Minora, ii. 151.) The same author tells us of
abbot Céolfrið:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Multa diu secum mente versans, utilius decrevit,
dato Fratribus praecepto, ut iuxta sui statuta privilegii, iuxtaque Regulam
sancti abbatis Benedicti, de suis sibi ipsi Patrem, qui aptior esset,
eligerent, etc.</span>” Vit. Bened. § 16. (Op. Min. ii. 156.) The author of the
anonymous life of St. Cúðberht, which is earlier than that of Beda,
says of Cúðberht at Lindisfarne:—“Vivens ibi quoque secundum
sanctam Scripturam, contemplativam vitam in actuali agens, et nobis
regularem vitam primus componens constituit, quam usque hodie cum
Regula Benedicti observamus.” Anon. Cúðb. § 25. (Bed. Op. Min.
ii. 271.) At a still later period, viz. the close of the seventh century,
we learn that the monastery of Hnutscilling or Nursling in Hampshire
was a Benedictine one, and St. Boniface a Benedictine monk. His
contemporary biographer Willibald says:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maxime suo sub regulari
videlicet disciplina abbati, monachica subditus obedientia praebebat,
ut labore manuum cottidiano et disciplinali officiorum amministratione
incessanter secundum praefinitam beati Patris Benedicti rectae constitutionis
formam insisteret,</span>” etc. Vit. Bonif. Pertz, ii. 336. One can
hardly imagine how Mr. Soames should suffer himself to be misled by
the exaggerations of Dúnstán’s monkish biographers: they are of a
piece with their whole story. That the rule had become very much relaxed
even in the Benedictine abbeys of this country is not to be doubted:
the same thing took place on the continent. Many had perished in the
Danish invasions; many had passed insensibly into the hands of secular
canons: and it is not at all improbable that in the middle of the tenth
century there was not a genuine Benedictine society left in England.
But this will certainly not justify the assertions of Bridferð or Adelard,
that Dúnstán was the first of English Benedictine monks or abbots.
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et hoc praedicto modo saluberrimam sancti Benedicti sequens institutionem,
primus abbas Anglicae nationis enituit,</span>” (Bridferð. MS. Cott.
Cleop. B. xii. fol. 72.)—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Monachorum ibi scholam primo primus instituere
coepit,</span>”—(Adel. in Angl. Sacra, ii. 101 <i>note</i>) are at the least
grave mistakes: one desires to believe that they are not something
worse; but they warn us to be extremely cautious how we admit the
authority of their writers as to any facts they may please to record.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f956'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r956'>956</a>. On this point Beda speaks most explicitly: “Sunt loca innumera,
ut novimus omnes, in monasteriorum ascripto vocabulum, sed nihil
prorsus monasticae conversationis habentia.” Ep. Ecgb. § 10. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod
enim turpe est dicere, tot sub nomine monasteriorum loca hi, qui monachicae
vitae prorsus sunt expertes, in suam ditionem acceperunt, sicut
ipse melius nosti,</span>” etc. Ibid. § 11. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">At alii graviore adhuc flagitio,
quum sint ipsi laici et nullius vitae regularis vel usu exerciti, vel
amore praediti, data regibus pecunia, emunt sibi sub praetextu monasteriorum
construendorum territoria, in quibus suae liberius vacent libidini,
et haec insuper in ius sibi haereditarium edictis regalibus faciunt
ascribi, ipsas quoque litteras privilegiorum suorum, quasi veraciter Deo
dignas, pontificum, abbatum et potestatum seculi, obtinent subscriptione
confirmari. Sicque usurpatis sibi agellulis sive vicis, liberi exinde
a divino simul et humano servitio, suis tantum inibi desideriis laici
monachis imperantes deserviunt; immo non monachos ibi congregant,
sed quoscunque ob culpam inobedientiae veris expulsos monasteriis
alicubi forte oberrantes invenerint, aut evocare monasteriis ipsi valuerint;
vel certe quos ipsi de suis satellitibus ad suscipiendam tonsuram,
promissa sibi obedientia monachica, invitare quiverint. Horum distortis
cohortibus suas, quas instruxere, cellas implent, multumque informi
atque inaudito spectaculo, idem ipsi viri modo coniugis ac liberorum
procreandorum curam gerunt, modo exsurgentes do cubilibus, quid
intra septa onasteriorum geri debeat sedula intentione pertractant....
Sic per annos circiter triginta, hoc est ex quo Aldfrid rex humanis
rebus ablatus est, provincia nostra vesano illo errore dementata est, ut
nullus pene exinde praefectorum extiterit, qui non huiusmodi sibi monasterium
in diebus suae praefecturae comparaverit, suamque simul
coniugem pari reatu nocivi mercatus astrinxerit; ac praevalente pessima
consuetudine, ministri quoque regis ac famuli idem facere sategerint.
Atque ita ordine perverso innumeri sunt inventi, qui se abbates
pariter et praefectos, sive ministros, aut famulos regis appellant; qui,
etsi aliquid vitae monasterialis ediscere laici, non experiendo sed audiendo,
potuerint, a persona tamen illa ac professione, quae hanc docere
debeat, sunt funditus exsortes; et quidem tales repente, ut nosti, tonsuram
pro suo libitu accipiunt, suo examine de laicis non monachi sed
abbates efficiuntur.</span>” Ibid. § 12, 13. (Bed. Op. Min. ii. 216, 218 <i>seq.</i>)
On these and other grounds Beda earnestly impresses upon Ecgberht
the duty of founding the twelve bishoprics contemplated by Gregory in
the province of York, in order to multiply the means of ecclesiastical
supervision. But if this was the condition of the Northumbrian monasteries
in the year 734, the period of Northumbria’s greatest literary
eminence, what may we conclude to have been the condition of similar
establishments in less instructed parts of England, especially after a
century of cruel wars had relaxed all the bonds of civilized society?
We may not greatly admire monachism, or believe it useful to a state;
but we can hardly blame those, who, finding the institution in existence,
desire to make the men who are attached to it worthy and not
unworthy members of their profession.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f957'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r957'>957</a>. In the often-cited letter to Ecgberht, Beda gives but a bad character
to some among the prelates of his time. He says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod non
ita loquor, quasi te aliter facere sciam, sed quia de quibusdam episcopis
fama vulgatum est, quod ipsi ita Christo serviant, ut nullos secum
alicuius religionis aut continentiae viros habeant; sed potius illos qui
risui, iocis, fabulis, commessationibus, et ebrietatibus, caeterisque vitae
remissioris illecebris subigantur, et qui magis quotidie ventrem dapibus
quam mentem sacrificiis coelestibus pascant.</span>” § 4 (Op Min. ii.

However, between the years 912 and 942, Berno, and his still more
celebrated successor Odo, abbots of Cluny, had introduced a reform of
the Benedictine rule in a great number of monasteries. Flodoardus
calls Odo: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dominus Odo, venerabilis abbas, multorum restaurator

  <h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER X. <br /> THE INCOME OF THE CLERGY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The means provided for the support of the clergy
were various at various periods, consisting sometimes
merely of voluntary donations on the part of
the people, sometimes of grants of lands, or settled
endowments, and sometimes of fixed charges upon
persons and property, recognized by the state and
levied under its authority: and after the secure
establishment of a Christian church in Britain, it is
probable that all these several sources of income
were combined to supply its ministers with a decent
maintenance, if not even an easy competence.
The grant of lands whereon to erect a church or a
monastery was generally calculated also to furnish
arable and pasture for the support of its inmates:
for the earliest clergy were in fact c&oelig;nobites, and
lived in common, even if they were not monks, and
subject to the Benedictine or some other Rule. It
is not at all probable that the heathen priesthood
should have been without an adequate provision,
whether in land or the free oblations of the people,
and very likely that their Christian successors profited
by the custom. As the piety or superstition
of the masses increased the landed possessions of
the clergy, these not only could depend upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>produce of their estates, but upon the rents in kind,
in money or in service, which they received from
tenants or poor dependents. And from early periods,
either custom or positive law had established
a right to claim certain contributions at fixed
periods of the year, or on particular occasions;
such were tithes of fruits of the earth, and young
of cattle; cyricsceat or first-fruits of seed, light-money,
plough-alms, and sáwlsceat or mortuary
fees. The numberless grants of lands recorded in
the Codex Diplomaticus in favour of the clergy,
dispense with the necessity of entering at any length
upon this head; but some more detailed examination
of the other church-dues is desirable, inasmuch
as they have been in some degree misunderstood by
several writers who have heretofore treated of them.
In truth, it was comparatively difficult to deal with
these subjects, till the publication of all the Anglosaxon
laws and a very large body of the charters
so greatly increased the number of data upon which
alone sound conclusions could be formed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The subject of tithe is surrounded with difficulty,
not only from the obscurity which belongs to its
history, but still more from the nature of the discussions
to which it has given rise. That from
periods so early as to transcend historical record
the clergy should have been permitted universally
to claim a tenth of all increase, does indeed seem
so startling a proposition, that we are little surprised
at its having met with angry opposition. It
does not seem consonant to the general experience
of man that in all nations precisely the same mode
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>should be adopted of supporting any class of men;
nor is it natural or easy to believe that a missionary
body, in constant danger of finding all their efforts
vain, should prevail at once to establish so serious
a claim against the income of their converts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still there are various circumstances which tend
to explain this process and show how a general
consent upon this subject did gradually prevail.
From the first moment when the clergy appear as
a separate class from the whole body of the faithful,
they appear as a body formed upon the plan
and guided by the maxims of the Jewish hierarchy.
While the church was literally performing the command
of the Saviour,—when those who had anything,
sold all they had and gave it to the poor,
through the hands of the Apostles,—there was no
particular necessity to define very closely the functions
or the remuneration of the ministers; these
gave their services as others did their wealth, as an
acceptable sacrifice to the Giver of all good things.
But when the number of the congregations increased,
when compromises were made, and more
complicated duties were imposed upon the ministers
of the church, it was only reasonable that some arrangement
should be made for their support, and
some rule imposed for their direction. It was not
too much to require that they should devote their
whole time and talents to the service of the congregation,
and that these in turn should relieve
them from the necessity of daily labour for subsistence.
When the duty of teaching, as well as
visiting the sick, distributing the alms of the faithful,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>and providing for the due celebration of the
religious rites, principally devolved upon them, it
would have been as impolitic as unjust to have condemned
them to uncertainty or anxiety as to their
daily bread. At a very early period the voluntary
oblations of the faithful were duly apportioned, and
a part devoted to the support of the clergy. But
no one, I imagine, will consider this to be a perfectly
satisfactory mode of providing for the ministers
of the church: its inconveniences are daily
manifested in our own time, and would now probably
not be submitted to at all, had opposition
not lent a dignity to the principle, and did the case
present any but the actual alternative. It nevertheless
seems that for nearly four hundred years
this was the only mode of providing not only for the
maintenance of the clergy, but for the acts of charity
which the Christian congregations considered their
especial duty<a id='r973' /><a href='#f973' class='c012'><sup>[973]</sup></a>; although perhaps here and there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>the wealthier or more pious communicants might
have charged their estates with settled payments at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>fixed times; or the liberality of individuals might
have presented estates to the church of particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>districts; or some imperfect system of funding
might have been adopted by the managers to
equalise the otherwise irregular income of various
years.</p>

<p class='c001'>The growing habit of looking upon the clergy as
the successors and representatives of the Levites
under the Old Law, may very likely have given the
impulse to that claim which they set up to the
payment of tithes by the laity. But it is also probable
that in course of time tithes had actually
been given to them among other oblations, and
had so helped to strengthen the application of the
Levitical Law by an apparent legal prescription.
There is not the least reason to doubt that payments
of a tenth had been in very common use
before the introduction of Christianity, and among
people who have a decimal system of notation, a
tenth is not an unlikely portion to be claimed as
a royalty, a recognitory service, or a rent. The
emperors had royalties of a tenth in mines: the
landlords very frequently reserved a tenth in lands
which they put out on usufructuary tenure. These
rents and royalties, like other property, had been
granted to the church. Again the piety of the
laity had occasionally remitted the tenths due upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>the lands in the holding of the clergy, which was
in fact equivalent to a grant of the tithe<a id='r974' /><a href='#f974' class='c012'><sup>[974]</sup></a>. And
lastly tithe being paid on some estates to the
clergy as landlords, there was a useful analogy,
and colourable claim of right: and thus sufficient
authority was found in custom itself to corroborate
pretensions set up on grounds which could not
be very satisfactorily or safely demurred to, in the
fourth and fifth centuries.</p>

<p class='c001'>But there is not the slightest proof that tithe of
increase was demanded as of right even in the fifth
century, in all the churches; although a growing
tendency in that direction may be detected in the
African and the Western establishments. Nor does
any general council exist containing any regulation
on the subject<a id='r975' /><a href='#f975' class='c012'><sup>[975]</sup></a>, till far later periods. But in 567
the clergy at the synod of Tours for the first time
positively called upon the faithful to pay tithes<a id='r976' /><a href='#f976' class='c012'><sup>[976]</sup></a>,
and eighteen years later at the Council of Macon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>the command was enforced, as a return to a just
and goodly custom which had fallen into desuetude,
but which had the sanction of “the divine
law, specially taking care of the interests of priests
and ministers of churches.” The daringly false
assertions by which this usurpation was attempted
to be justified are recorded in the annexed note, if
indeed the acts of this council are genuine<a id='r977' /><a href='#f977' class='c012'><sup>[977]</sup></a>: I have
only to add that they were subscribed by forty-six
bishops, and the representatives of twenty more,—making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>a total of sixty-six prelates, a number quite
sufficient in the year 585 to gain currency for any
fabrication however impudent. The clergy however
still thundered in vain; nor was it till 779
that they succeeded in getting legislative and state
authority for their claim through the political interests
of the Frankish princes. The Capitulary of
that year enacts that every one shall give tithes,
and that these shall be distributed by the direction
of the bishop<a id='r978' /><a href='#f978' class='c012'><sup>[978]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ten years after the council of Macon had thus
boldly announced its views with regard to tithe,
Augustine set out for England.</p>

<p class='c001'>The question as to the origin of tithes in England,
as to its date, and the authority on which the
impost rested, has been much discussed, but not
altogether satisfactorily. Nevertheless when divested
of the extraneous difficulties with which polemical
zeal, and selfish class-interests have overwhelmed
it, it does not seem incapable of a reasonable
solution. It is well known that the earliest
legislative enactment on the subject in the Anglosaxon
laws is that of Æðelstán, bearing date in the
first quarter of the tenth century; and that nearly
every subsequent king recognized the right of the
clergy to tithe, and made regulations either for the
levying or the distribution of it<a id='r979' /><a href='#f979' class='c012'><sup>[979]</sup></a>. But although
this is the case, I entertain no doubt whatever that
the payment of tithe was become very general in
England at an earlier period. It is recognised in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>the articles of the treaty of peace between Eádweard
the elder and Guðorm, in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 900 or 901,
in such a way as to assume its being a well-known
and established due to the Church<a id='r980' /><a href='#f980' class='c012'><sup>[980]</sup></a>, even though
no legislative enactment on the subject can be
shown in the Codes of Ælfred, Ini or the Kentish
kings<a id='r981' /><a href='#f981' class='c012'><sup>[981]</sup></a>. The well-known tradition of Æðelwulf’s
granting tithe, throughout at least his kingdom of
Wessex, carries it back still half a century. But
even this falls short of the antiquity which we must
assume for the custom, if we believe in the genuineness
of the ancient Poenitentials and Confessionals.
In the eighth century Theodore determines,
in a work especially intended for the instruction
of the clergy, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tributum aecclesiae sit,
sicut est consuetudo provinciae, id est, ne tantum
pauperes in decimis, aut in aliquibus rebus vim
patiantur. Decimas non est legitimum dare, nisi
pauperibus et peregrinis</span><a id='r982' /><a href='#f982' class='c012'><sup>[982]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>The Excerptions of Archbishop Ecgberht<a id='r983' /><a href='#f983' class='c012'><sup>[983]</sup></a> contain
a prohibition against subtracting tithes from
churches of old foundation, on pretence of giving
them to new oratories. And further, the following
exhortation respecting this payment<a id='r984' /><a href='#f984' class='c012'><sup>[984]</sup></a>: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In lege
Domini scriptum est: ‘Decimas et primitias non
tardabis offerre.’ Et in Levitico: ‘Omnes decimae
terrae, sive de frugibus, sive de pomis arborum,
Domini sunt; boves, et oves, et caprae, quae
sub pastoris virga transeunt, quicquid decimum
venerit, sanctificabitur Domino.’ Non eligetur nec
bonum nec malum, nec alterum commutabitur.
Augustinus dicit: Decimae igitur tributae sunt
aecclesiarum et egentium animarum. O homo,
inde Dominus decimas expetit, unde vivis. De
militia, de negotio, de artificio redde decimas; non
enim eget Dominus noster, non proemia postulat,
sed honorem.</span>” The same ancient authority thus
also impresses upon priests the duty of collecting
and distributing the tithe<a id='r985' /><a href='#f985' class='c012'><sup>[985]</sup></a>:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut unusquisque sacerdos
cunctos sibi pertinentes erudiat, ut sciant
qualiter decimas totius facultatis aecclesiis divinis
debite offerant. Ut ipsi sacerdotes a populis suscipiant
decimas, et nomina eorum quicumque dederint
scripta habeant, et secundum auctoritatem
canonicam coram [Deum] timentibus dividant; et
ad ornamentum aecclesiae primam eligant partem;
secundam autem, ad usum pauperum atque peregrinorum,
per eorum manus misericorditer cum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>omni humilitate dispensent; tertiam vero sibimetipsis
sacerdotes reservent</span><a id='r986' /><a href='#f986' class='c012'><sup>[986]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When we consider the growing tendency in the
clergy to make payment of tithe compulsory, the
repeated exhortations of provincial synods to that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>effect, and the universal ignorance of the people,
we shall have little difficulty in acknowledging that
the English prelates laid a good foundation for the
custom of tithing, long before they succeeded in
obtaining any legal right from the State. In the
course of three centuries which preceded Eádweard’s
reign they had ample time and opportunity
to threaten or cajole a simple-minded race into the
belief that they had a right to impose the levitical
obligations upon them: in the seventh century
Boniface testifies to the payment of tithe in England,
nearly a century before the state enacted it
in Germany: about the same period Cædwealha of
Wessex, though yet nominally a pagan, tithed his
spoils taken in war; and I have little doubt that
at least prædial tithe was almost universally levied
long before the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena gemót</span> made it a legal
charge, though I cannot concur with Phillips in
believing that it was so decreed by Offa, or confirmed
by Æðelwulf<a id='r987' /><a href='#f987' class='c012'><sup>[987]</sup></a>, for the whole kingdoms of
Mercia and Wessex.</p>

<p class='c001'>We will now return to Æðelwulf’s so-called
grant, in which many of our lawyers and historians
have been content to see the legal origin of tithing
in this country<a id='r988' /><a href='#f988' class='c012'><sup>[988]</sup></a>; but which I must confess appears
to me to have nothing to do with tithing whatever,
in the legal sense of the word. The reports of the
later chroniclers need not be taken into account;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>we may confine ourselves to the early and trustworthy
sources, whose assertions we are quite as
likely to make proper use of as the compilers of
the fourteenth century.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under date of the year 855, the Saxon Chronicle
says. “This same year, Æðelwulf booked the
tenth part of his land throughout his realm, for
God’s glory and his own salvation.” Asser, who
was no question well acquainted with the traditions
of Æðelwulf’s house, varies the statement:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eodem anno Æðhelwulfus praefatus venerabilis
rex decimam totius regni sui partem ab omni regali
servitio et tributo liberavit, in sempiternoque
graphio in cruce Christi, pro redemptione animae
suae et antecessorum suorum, uni et trino Deo
immolavit</span><a id='r989' /><a href='#f989' class='c012'><sup>[989]</sup></a>.” In this he is followed verbatim by
Florence of Worcester. Æðelweard, a direct descendant
of Æðelwulf, thus records the grant<a id='r990' /><a href='#f990' class='c012'><sup>[990]</sup></a>:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In eodem anno decumavit Æðulf rex de omni
possessione sua in partem Domini, et in universo
regimine principatus sui sic constituit.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>Simeon has:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo tempore rex Ethelwulfus
rex decimavit totum regni sui imperium, pro redemptione
animae suae et antecessorum suorum.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>Huntingdon:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æðelwulfus decimo nono anno
regni sui totam terram suam ad opus aecclesiarum
decumavit, propter amorem Dei et redemptionem
sui.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris, upon
the authority of Æðelwulf’s charter of 854, say:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eodem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>anno rex magnificus Athelwulfus decimam
regni sui partem Deo et Beatae Mariae et omnibus
sanctis contulit, liberam ab omnibus servitiis saecularibus
exactionibus et tributis.</span>” And again in
857, speaking of Æðelwulf’s will:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro utilitate
animae suae et salute, per omne regnum suum
semper in decem hidis vel mansionibus pauperem
unum indigenam, vel peregrinum cibo, potu et operimento,
successoribus suis usque in finem saeculi
post se pascere praecepit, ita tamen ut si terra illa
pecoribus abundaret et ab hominibus coleretur.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>Malmesbury, who calls the charter of 854 “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriptum
libertatis aecclesiarum quod toti concessit Angliae,</span>”
thus describes its effect:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ethelwulfus ...
decimam omnium hidarum infra regnum suum
Christi famulis concessit, liberam ab omnibus functionibus,
absolutam ab omnibus inquietudinibus.</span>”
And in 857, with reference to Æðelwulfs will:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Semperque
ad finem saeculi in omni suae haereditatis
decima hida pauperem vestiri et cibari praecepit.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>These passages obviously relate to two several
transactions, one which took place in the year 854,
before Æðelwulf’s visit to Rome, the second in
the year 857, after his return to England: and the
Codex Diplomaticus contains a series of documents
referring to them<a id='r991' /><a href='#f991' class='c012'><sup>[991]</sup></a>. A portion of these fall under
the description of Malmesbury, viz. that of “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriptum
libertatis aecclesiarum.</span>” and as he cites one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>of them himself by that title, it is certain that
these are what he intends. Now this document,
after the usual proem, recites that Æðelwulf with
the consent of his witan, not only gave the tenth
part of the lands throughout his realm to holy
churches, but granted to his ministers, appointed
throughout the same, to have in perpetual freedom,
so that his donation might remain for ever free
from all royal and secular burthens: in consideration
of which the bishops agreed to a special service
weekly for the king and his nobles<a id='r992' /><a href='#f992' class='c012'><sup>[992]</sup></a>, every Saturday.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another class, and probably the most genuine,
comprises the numbers 275 and 1048; in these
documents, which are also grants of immunity to
the clergy and to laics, the granting words are
as follows:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quamobrem ego Æðelwulfus rex
Occidentalium Saxonum cum consilio episcoporum
et principum meorum, consilium salubre atque uniforme
remedium affirmavi; ut aliquam portionem
terrarum haereditariam, antea possidentibus gradibus
omnibus,—sive famulis et famulabus Dei Deo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>servientibus, sive laicis,—semper decimam mansionem,
ubi minimum sit, tum decimam partem,—in
libertatem perpetuam perdonare diiudicavi; ut sit
tuta et munita ab omnibus saecularibus servitutibus,
fiscis regalibus, tributis maioribus et minoribus, sive
taxationibus quae nos dicimus Wíterǽden; sitque
libera omnium rerum, pro remissione animarum et
peccatorum nostrorum, Deo soli ad serviendum,
sine expeditione, et pontis instructione et arcis
munitione, ut eo diligentius pro nobis ad Deum
preces sine cessatione fundant, quo eorum servitutem
saecularem in aliqua parte levigamus.</span>” In
consideration of this alleviation the grateful clergy
were to perform on the Wednesday in every week
the same services as the first class of documents
stipulates for the Saturday. It is to be observed
that the two documents of this particular class,
though the authority for them is of the lowest description,
and the dates are altogether suspicious,
seem to be of a much more genuine character as
to the grant itself than the first class: there is a
certain satisfactory accuracy about the definition of
Wíterǽden which is in so far suggestive of an authentic
original; and when we translate the very
bad Latin “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine expeditione,</span>” etc. by the genuine
“<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bútan fyrdfare,</span>” etc., we shall have the following
reasonable account to give of the proceedings.
Æðelwulf, being humbled and terrified by the distresses
of wars and the ravages of barbarous and
pagan invaders, devised as a useful remedy thus; he
determined to liberate from all those various exactions
and services which went by the general name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wíteræden</span>, the tenth part of the estates which,
though hereditary tenure had grown up in them,
were still subject to the ancient burthens of folcland,
whether they were in the hands of laics or
clergy; that where the estate amounted to ten
hides, one was to be free; where it was a very
small quantity, at all events a tenth was to be so
enfranchised: and as the greater part of this land
either was in the hands of the clergy, or was very
likely ultimately to come there, he granted this
charitable act of enfranchisement that on these
estates the holders might be the better able to devote
themselves to the service of God, all other
service being discharged, except indeed the inevitable
three. This seems best to accord with
Asser’s assertion that the king sacrificed to God
the services which arose to himself over a tenth
part of all his realm. Now it is to be observed
that this could not apply to booklands which
already possessed an exemption, but only to folcland,
whether become hereditary or not; nor could
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>regnum</i></span> possibly mean territory, but royal rights,
for Æðelwulf had no <em>territory</em> except his private
estates; nor could the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">trinoda necessitas</span>” be
called a “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">regale servitium et tributum.</span>” These
were the dues demandable by the king from folcland,
and could only be discharged by consent of
the Wítan. The expression of Simeon appears
also to be susceptible of no other translation:
when he says the king tithed “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">totum regni sui
imperium,</span>” I can see no territorial division in
his words, but only that the king relinquished a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>tenth part of those imperial rights which he had as
king.</p>

<p class='c001'>A third class of documents however yet remains
to be considered. In these a clear division of lands
is intended and is recorded. The first of these in
point of time are the Nos. 1051 and 1052, which
bear the suspicious dates of Easter in the year 854,
the first indiction, and the palace at Wilton: that
is, with the exception of the indiction, the dates of
the first class of documents. These two charters
declare that Æðelwulf being determined by the advice
of St. Swithin to tithe the lands of all the
realm that God had given him<a id='r993' /><a href='#f993' class='c012'><sup>[993]</sup></a>, increased the estate
which queen Friðogyð had granted to the church
at Winchester, in Taunton, by a certain amount
of hides in various places. These are followed by
another of the same year, but with the proper indiction,
viz. the second, declaring that on the same
occasion he gave other lands to Winchester<a id='r994' /><a href='#f994' class='c012'><sup>[994]</sup></a>; and
in the succeeding year 855, we find him giving an
estate in Kent to Dun a minister or thane, “pro
decimatione agrorum, quam Deo donante, caeteris
ministris meis facere decrevi.” I do not very much
insist upon giving one sense rather than another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>to this “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>pro</em> decimatione</span>,” and am ready to admit
that it may mean, ‘in respect of the general tithing
of lands which I intend to make to yourself as well
as the rest of my thanes,’ or that it may be read,
‘in place of that tithing of lands which I intend to
make to the rest of my thanes, I give you such
and such a particular estate.’ We must not be very
fastidious with Æðelwulf’s Latin, especially as
there is much reason to believe that in this case it
is a mere translation of what would have been far
more intelligible and trustworthy Saxon.</p>

<p class='c001'>Trustworthy, however, I can hardly term the last
document I have to notice<a id='r995' /><a href='#f995' class='c012'><sup>[995]</sup></a>, Saxon though it be:
this appears to be one of a very suspicious series
of instruments, prepared for the purpose of corroborating
some ancient claim on the part of Winchester,
to have its hundred hides at Chilcombe
rated at <em>one</em> hide only. It bears marks of forgery in
every line, and seems to have been made up out of
some history of Æðelwulf’s sojourn in Rome, but
still is worth citing as evidence of the tradition respecting
tithe:—“In the name of him who writeth
in the book of life in heaven those who in this life
please him well, I Æðulf the king in this writ
notify concerning the franchise of Chilcombe, which
Kynegils the king, who first of all the kings in
Wessex became a Christian, granted to his baptismal
father Saint Birinus; and which since then
all the kings who have succeeded one another in
Wessex have enfranchised and advanced, although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>it never was reduced to writing until the time of
myself, who am the ninth king. Also I notify that
I established this franchise before Saint Peter in
Rome, and the holy Pope Leo, even so as it was
settled between me and all my people, ere I went
to Rome, that is, that all the land comprised in
this franchise shall for ever be acquitted for one
hide; because God’s possessions should ever be
more free than any worldly possession: and also
my son Ælfred, who went with me and was there
consecrated king, pledged himself to the Pope, both
to further this franchise himself, and to urge his
children to the same, if God should grant him any.
I also, before the same Pope, tithed all the landed
possessions which I had in England, to God, into
holy places for myself and for all my people: and
in Rome with the assistance and by the leave of the
Pope, I wrought a minster for the honour of God
and to the worship of Saint Mary, his holy mother,
and placed therein a company of English, who ever
both by night and day shall serve God, for our
people: and when I returned home I told all the
people what I had done in Rome. And they very
earnestly thanked both God and me for this, and
all this pleased them well, and they said that with
their good will it should be so for ever. Now I
implore, through the holy Trinity and Saint Peter,
and all the halidome that I visited in Rome, both
for myself and my people, that never either king or
prince, bishop or ealdorman, thane or reeve diminish
what hath been established with such witness:
doubtless he that doth so will anger God and Saint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>Peter, and all the saints that repose in the churches
at Rome, and miserably earn for himself the punishments
of hell. Moreover, the aforesaid holy Pope
Leo laid God’s curse and Saint Peter’s, and all
the Saints’ and his own, on him that ever violates
this; and also all this people both ordained and laic
did the like when I returned home and announced
this to them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>If these data then be correct, Æðelwulf did three
distinct things at different times: he first released
from all payments, except the inevitable three, a
tenth part of the folclands or unenfranchised lands,
whether in the tenancy of the church or of his
thanes. In this tenth part of the lands so burthened
in his favour he annihilated the royal rights,
regnum or imperium; and as the lands receiving
this privilege were secured by charter, the Chronicle
can justly say that the king <em>booked</em> them to
the honour of God. A second thing he did, inasmuch
as he gave a tenth part of his own private
estates of bookland to various thanes or clerical
establishments. And lastly, upon every ten hides
of his own land he commanded that one poor man,
whether native born or stranger, that is, whether
of Wessex or some other kingdom, should be maintained
in food and clothing. It is unnecessary to
waste words in showing how utterly different all
this really is from any grant of tithe, and how
entirely unfounded is the opinion that Æðelwulf
made the first legal enactment in behalf of tithe in
this country. All that it proves is, that Æðelwulf
made a handsome endowment for the clergy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>that a tenth part or a tenth person seemed to him
to mark the proper proportion between what he
kept and what he gave up. It renders it probable
that the claim to tithe had already become familiar,
since Æðelwulf divided his land by ten; but it also
shows that even the Levitical tithe itself was misrepresented,
if he believed this donation of his to
bear any resemblance to it. We may suppose the
squire in a country parish to have let the parson
a house, and subsequently excused him a tenth of
the rent. This might be a very charitable act, and
might be done from very pure religious motives;
but it would scarcely be called tithe in the proper
ecclesiastical sense of that word. This is precisely
what Æðelwulf did in Wessex.</p>

<p class='c001'>In addition to <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">leohtsceat</span>, or money paid to supply
lights, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sulhælmysse</span> or plough-alms, and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sáwlsceat</span>,
a present made to the church where a testator
desired to rest, in consideration of religious services
to be performed for the good of his soul, there was
a due commonly known under the name of cyricsceat.
It is not clear what was the nature of this
impost, and its amount is uncertain, as well as the
persons who were liable to its payment. But in all
probability it was at first a recognitory rent paid
to the particular churches from estates leased by
them; not so much in the nature of a fair equivalent
for the use of such lands, but as a token of
beneficiary tenure, in the spirit of the following
words:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Solventes inde censum per singulos
annos missis rectorum praedicti monasterii, iv denarios
in festivitate sancti Remigii Confessoris, ne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>videamur eas ex proprio, sed iure beneficiario possidere</span><a id='r996' /><a href='#f996' class='c012'><sup>[996]</sup></a>.”
It is therefore not unusual to find this
impost particularly mentioned in church-leases,
under the names of cyricsceat, census aecclesiasticus,
cyriclád, aecclesiae munus, and similar terms.
The true character of the payment appears from
two very clear examples which I shall quote at
length. “That in truth may say the thane Ælfsige
Hunláfing in respect to his obtaining this land
free from every burthen, to himself and his heirs,
except burhbót, bridge-work, and military service,
remembering to his <em>landlord</em>, cyricsceat, sáwlsceat
and his tithes<a id='r997' /><a href='#f997' class='c012'><sup>[997]</sup></a>.” This landlord was a bishop, in
all probability, but he is not named.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the year 902, Denewulf bishop of Winchester
leased fifteen hides of land to Beornwulf and his
heirs, reserving a rent of forty-five shillings yearly.
“And every year let him assist in the bót of the
church<a id='r998' /><a href='#f998' class='c012'><sup>[998]</sup></a> which that land belongeth to, in the same
proportion as the other folk do, each by the measure
of his land; and let him justly pay his cyricsceat,
and perform his military service and bridge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>and fortress work, as they do throughout all the
folk<a id='r999' /><a href='#f999' class='c012'><sup>[999]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Between the years 879 and 909, the same bishop
gave forty hides to Ælfred, for his life. Upon these
he reserved a rent of three pounds, cyricsceats,
cyricsceat-work, and the services of Ælfred’s men
when required at the bishop’s hunting and reaping<a id='r1000' /><a href='#f1000' class='c012'><sup>[1000]</sup></a>.
In like manner Oswald reserved, in all the grants
he made out of the church property at Worcester,
the church rights, that is to say, cyricsceat, toll,
tax and pannage, and also the services of the
tenants at his hunting<a id='r1001' /><a href='#f1001' class='c012'><sup>[1001]</sup></a>. Lastly between the years
871 and 877, bishop Ealhfrið granting eight hides
for three lives to duke Cúðred, reserved bridge-work,
military service, eight cyricsceats, the mass-priest’s
rights and soulsceats<a id='r1002' /><a href='#f1002' class='c012'><sup>[1002]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cyricsceat</span> then appears to have been originally
a recognitory service due to the lord from
the tenant on church-lands. But it is very clear
that in process of time a new character was assumed
for it, and it was claimed of all men alike, as a
due to the clergy. Here, again, the Levitical
legislation was taken to be applicable to the Christian
ministry. The Jews had been commanded to
give first-fruits<a id='r1003' /><a href='#f1003' class='c012'><sup>[1003]</sup></a>, as well as tithes; and if tithes
belonged to the clergy by virtue of God’s commandment,
so did first-fruits also. These appear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>also to have been called <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cyricsceat</span>, and after a time
became an established charge upon the land of the
freeman as well as the unfree. The earliest legislation
which we can discover, bearing unquestionably
upon this point, is that of Eádmund toward
the middle of the tenth century<a id='r1004' /><a href='#f1004' class='c012'><sup>[1004]</sup></a>; he strictly commands
payment of tithe, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cyricsceat</span>, and almsfee,
and declares that he who will not do it shall be excommunicated.
By the time of Eádgár however
the matter seems to have been quite settled, and
cyricsceat is directed to be paid from the hearth of
every freeman to the old minster,—most likely to
prevent a course similar to the arbitrary consecration
of tithes. And this remained a fixed charge
upon the land till the time of the Conquest, when
it ceased to be generally paid, as we may judge
from the expressions of Fleta and other jurists<a id='r1005' /><a href='#f1005' class='c012'><sup>[1005]</sup></a>; it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>had passed in some cases into the hands of secular
lords, with lands alienated by the clergy, or taken
from them. But in the time of Cnut it was still paid
as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>primitiae seminum</i></span>, and it is not probable that his
successors altered his arrangements in this respect.</p>

<p class='c001'>The liberality of the Anglosaxons was by no
means confined to the grants of land which they
conferred upon the several churches, although it
is impossible to deny that these were most extravagant<a id='r1006' /><a href='#f1006' class='c012'><sup>[1006]</sup></a>.
At the same time it is to be borne in
mind that the clergy were always certain to command
a more than adequate supply of free and
unfree labour; and that, if their landed possessions
thus increased their wealth to an extraordinary
degree, they also were the greatest contributors to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>the general well-being through the superior excellence
of their cultivation. But the piety or the
fears of the laity did not stop short at gifts of land
and serfs: jewels, cups, rings, crosses and caskets,
money, tapestry, and vestments, annual foundations
of bread, wine, beer, honey, and flesh, sometimes
to enormous amounts, were devised by the will
of wealthy and penitent sinners: houses and curtilages,
tolls and markets, forests, harbours, fisheries,
mines, commons of pasture and mast, flocks and
herds of swine, horses and oxen, testified to the
liberality of ealdormen and kings. Nor was the
opportunity of investing their surplus profitably
always wanting: more than one mortgage is recorded,
on terms sufficiently favourable to the
mortgagors; and loans on excellent security, show
that if the nobles knew where to find capitalists
in their need, the capitalist also knew very well
how to turn his facilities to good account. The
necessity of providing out of these large funds for
the proper maintenance of the churches and the
due celebration of religious rites, can hardly be
looked upon as a great hardship; and although the
demands of charity and the duties of hospitality,
may have seemed a heavy charge to the avaricious
or the selfish, we cannot but conclude, that no
class of the community occupied so dignified or so
easy a position as the Anglosaxon clergy. The
State, fully aware of the value of their services,
was not niggardly in rewarding them. There was
a ready acquiescence on the part of the laity in
the claims of the clergy to respect and trust; and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>while these continued to maintain a decent conformity
to the duties of their calling, we find a perfectly
harmonious co-operation of all classes in the
church. Nor, amongst all the writings which the
clergy—the only writers—have left us, do we find
any of those complaints and grievances, which are
apt to be made prominent enough when the members
of that powerful body believe their pretensions
to be treated with less than due consideration. The
devoted partizan of Rome might choose to declare
the English church subject to such bondage as no
other suffered; but, except from quarrels of their
own, the clergy never were exposed here to those
inconveniences which are unavoidable, upon any
attempt on their part to separate themselves from
their fellow-members in the Christian communion.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<div class='footnote' id='f973'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r973'>973</a>. “Till toward the end of the first four hundred [years] no payment of
them [<i>i. e.</i> tithes] can be proved to have been in use. Some <em>opinion</em> is of
their being due, and <em>constitutions</em> also, but such as are of no credit.
For the first, ’tis best declared by showing the course of the church-maintenance
in that time. So liberal in the beginning of Christianity
was the devotion of the believers, that their bounty to the evangelical
priesthood far exceeded what the tenth could have been. For if you
look to the first of the Apostles’ times, then the unity of heart among
them about Jerusalem, was such that all was in common and none
wanted, ‘and as many as were possessors of lands or houses, sold them
and brought the price of the things that were sold, and laid it down at
the Apostles’ feet, and it was distributed unto every man, according as
he had need<a id='ra' /><a href='#fa' class='c012'><sup>[a]</sup></a>.’And the whole church, both lay and clergy, then
lived in common as the monks did afterward about the end of the first
four hundred years as St. Chrysostome notes<a id='rb' /><a href='#fb' class='c012'><sup>[b]</sup></a> οὕτως, says he, οἱ ἐν τοῖς
μοναστηρίοις ζῶσι νῦν ὥσπερ τότε οἱ πιστοὶ, that is, ‘So they live now in
monasteries as then the believers lived.’ But this kind of having all
things in common scarce at all continued. For we see not long after
in the church of Antiochia (where Christianity was first of all by that
name professed) every one of the disciples had a special ability or estate
of his own<a id='rc' /><a href='#fc' class='c012'><sup>[c]</sup></a>. So in Galatia and in Corinth where St. Paul ordained
that weekly offerings for the Saints should be given by every man as he
had thrived in his estate<a id='rd' /><a href='#fd' class='c012'><sup>[d]</sup></a>. By example of these, the course of monthly
offerings succeeded in the next ages. These monthly offerings given
by devout and able Christians, the bishops or officers appointed in the
church received<a id='re' /><a href='#fe' class='c012'><sup>[e]</sup></a>; and carefully and charitably disposed them on
Christian worship, the maintenance of the clergy, feeding, clothing,
and burying their poor brethren, widows, orphans, persons tyrannically
condemned to the mines, to prison, or punished by deportation into
isles. They were called <em>Stipes</em> (which is a word borrowed from the
use of the heathens in their collections made for their temples and
deities), neither were they exacted by canon or otherwise, but arbitrarily
given; as by testimony of most learned Tertullian<a id='rf' /><a href='#ff' class='c012'><sup>[f]</sup></a>, that lived
about <span class='fss'>CC</span> years after Christ, is apparent: ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neque pretio</span> (are his
words) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulla res Dei constat. Etiam si quod arcae genus est, non de
oneraria summa quasi redemptae religionis congregatur, modicam unusquisque
Stipem, menstruâ die, vel cum velit, et si modo velit, et si
modo possit, apponit. Nam nemo compellitur, sed sponte confert.
Haec quasi deposita pietatis sunt.</span>’ And then he shewes the employment
of them in those charitable uses. Some authority is<a id='rg' /><a href='#fg' class='c012'><sup>[g]</sup></a>, that about
this time lands began also to be given to the church. If they were
so, out of the profits of them, and this kind of offerings, was made
a treasure; and out of that, which was increased so monthly, was
a monthly pay given to the priests and ministers of the Gospel
(as a salarie for their service), and that either by the hand or care
of the bishop, or of some elders appointed as Oeconomi or Wardens.
These monthly pays they called Mensurnae divisiones, as you
may see in St. Cyprian<a id='rh' /><a href='#fh' class='c012'><sup>[h]</sup></a>, who wrote, being bishop of Carthage, about
the year <span class='fss'>CCL</span>, and, speaking familiarly of this use, calls the brethren
that cast in their monthly offerings, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fratres sportulantes</i></span>, understanding
the offerings under the word Sportulae, which at first in
Rome denoted a kind of running banquets distributed at great men’s
houses to such as visited for salutation, which being ofttimes also given
in money, the word came at length to signify both those salaries, wages
or fees which either judges<a id='ri' /><a href='#fi' class='c012'><sup>[i]</sup></a> or ministers of courts of justice received
as due to their places, as also to denote the oblations given to make a
treasure for the salaries and maintenance of the ministers of the church
in this primitive age, and to this purpose was it also used in later
times<a id='rj' /><a href='#fj' class='c012'><sup>[j]</sup></a>. But because that passage of St. Cyprian, where he uses this
phrase, well shows also the course of the maintenance of the church in
his time, take it here transcribed: but first know the drift of his Epistle
to be a reprehension of Geminius Faustinus a priest his being troubled
with the care of a wardship, whereas such as take that dignity upon
them, should, he says, be free from all secular troubles like the Levites,
who were provided for in tithes. ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut qui</span> (as he writes<a id='rk' /><a href='#fk' class='c012'><sup>[k]</sup></a>) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">operationibus
divinis insistebant, in nulla re avocarentur, nec cogitare aut agere
saecularia cogerentur.</span>’ And then he adds: ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quae nunc ratio et forma
in Clero tenetur, ut qui in ecclesia Domini ad ordinationem clericalem
promoventur, nullo modo ab administratione divina avocentur, sed in
honore sportulantium fratrum, tanquam Decimas ex fructibus accipientes,
ab Altari et Sacrificiis non recedant, et die ac nocte coelestibus
rebus et spiritualibus serviant;</span>’ which plainly agrees with that course
of monthly pay, made out of the oblations brought into the Treasury;
which kind of means he compares to that of the Levites, as being proportionable.
But hence also ’tis manifest, that no payment of tithes
was in St. Cyprian’s time in use, although some, too rashly, from this
very place would infer so much, those words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tanquam Decimas accipientes</i></span>
(which continues the comparing of ministers of the Gospel with
the Levites) plainly exclude them. And elsewhere also the same Father,
finding fault with a coldness of devotion that then possest many, in
regard of what was in use in the Apostles’ times, and seeing that the
Oblations given were less than usually before, expresses<a id='rl' /><a href='#fl' class='c012'><sup>[l]</sup></a> their neglect
to the church with, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ac nunc de patrimonio nec Decimas damus:</span>’
whence, as you may gather, that no usual payment was of them, so
withall observe in his expression, that the liberality formerly used had
been such, that, in respect thereof, Tenths were but a small part:
understand it as if he had said, ‘but now we give not so much as any
part worth speaking of.’ Neither for aught appears in old monuments
of credit, till near the end of this first four hundred years, was any
payment to the Church of any tenth part, as a Tenth, at all in use.”

very great doubts upon the authenticity of this canon of the Council
of Macon, and that it is of very questionable authority. See his History
of Tithes, cap. 5. p. 65. It is hardly consistent with what Agobard
of Lyons, who shortly after was bishop of the see itself in which Macon
lies, declares: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iam vero de donandis rebus et ordinandis aecclesiis
nihil unquam in Synodis constitutum est, nihil a sanctis patribus publice
praedicatum. Nulla enim compulit necessitas, fervente ubique
religiosa devotione, et amore illustrandi aecclesias ultro aestuante,</span>” etc.
Agob. Lugdun. de Dispensatione, etc. p. 276. (Ed. Masson. Parisiis.)
But as Eichhorn, who has deeply investigated this subject, appears to
differ here from Selden, I have cited this Council on his responsibility,
and with the more readiness, that it rather opposes than confirms my
own opinion.</p>

but I think that in this case he has probability on his side, if we restrict
the grant to Offa’s demesne lands, or to a release of a tenth of
the dues payable to the king on Folcland. A general enactment, comprising
the whole kingdom, would scarcely have been omitted in any
subsequent collection of laws. The law of Offa is indeed lost, but some
of its provisions probably survive in the legislation of later kings. See
Ælfr. Proem. Thorpe, i. 58. The absence of all mention of tithe by
Ælfred is not conclusive: he takes just as little notice of cyricsceat,
leohtsceat, sáwlsceat, and other payments which were unquestionably
claimed by the church. Eádweard’s treaty with Gúðorm, though it
does not define the parties from whom tithe was demandable, treats
subtraction of it as an offence punishable at law.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r986'>986</a>. The custom of the Romish church, as is well known, divided every
oblation, or gain that accrued to the church from the contributions of
the faithful, into four parts,—one for the bishop, one for the poor, one
for the clergy, and one for the repairs of the fabric. Othlon, who wrote
the Life of St. Boniface in the twelfth century, thus appeals to the universal
custom of the church: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quando quidem iuxta sanctorum canonum
decreta decimas in quatuor portiones dividentes, unam, sibi [i. e.
the bishops], alteram clericis, tertiam pauperibus, quartam restaurandis
aecclesiis tradiderunt? Numquid avaritiae suae tantummodo consulentes,
in distributione decimarum obliti sunt pauperum, restaurationisque
aecclesiarum, sicut modo, pro dolor! cernimus agi? Canones enim
sancti, ex quorum auctoritate exiguntur decimae, non solum decimas
dari, sed etiam inter varios aecclesiae usus distribui; ut in urbibus quibuslibet
et vicis Xenodochia habeantur, ubi pauperes et peregrini alantur.
Sed tam sanctum et tam necessarium praeceptum in pluribus
locis non solum minime curatur, sed etiam poene ignoratur. Nam solummodo
illud legitur, quod epicopis decimae sint tribuendae; quid
vero exinde agendum sit, vel si quidquam aliud curandum sit circa monasteria,
tam a clericis—miserabile dictu—quam a laicis destructa, citraque
iudicia religionis Christianae subversa, oblivioni seu ignorantiae
commendatur.</span>” Pertz, ii. 358. In the commencement of the seventh
century, Gregory, in his rules for the government of the newly-planted
English church, directed Augustine to make not four but three portions,
inasmuch as he being a monk could have no separate share of
his own. He says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mos autem sedis apostolicae est ordinatis episcopis
praecepta tradere, ut in omni stipendio, quod accedit, quatuor
debeant fieri portiones: una videlicet episcopo et familiae propter hospitalitatem
atque susceptionem, alia clero, tertia pauperibus, quarta
aecclesiis reparandis. Sed quia tua fraternitas monasterii regulis erudita,
seorsum fieri non debet a clericis suis in aecclesia Anglorum quae,
auctore Deo, nuper adhuc ad fidem adducta est, hanc debet conversationem
instituere, quae initio nascentis aecclesiae fuit patribus nostris;
in quibus nullus eorum ex his, quae possidebant, aliquid suum esse dicebat,
sed erant eis omnia communia.</span>” Beda, H. E. i. 27. The original

  <h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER XI. <br /> THE POOR.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There is hardly a question connected with the
march of civilization more difficult to answer satisfactorily
than this: What is to be done with the
Poor?</p>

<p class='c001'>In our own day, when subdivision of labour has
been carried to an unheard of extent, when property
follows the natural law of accumulation in masses,
and society numbers the proletarian as an inevitable
unit among its constituents, the question presents
itself in a threatening and dangerous form, with
difficulty surrounding it on every side, and anarchy
scowling in the background, hardly to be appeased
or vanquished. But such circumstances as those
we live under are rare, and almost unexampled
in history: even the later and depraved days of
Roman civilization offer but a very insufficient
pattern of a similar condition<a id='r1007' /><a href='#f1007' class='c012'><sup>[1007]</sup></a>. Above all it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>be difficult to find any parallel for them in countries
where land is abundant, and the accumulation
of property slow: there may be pauperism in New
York, but scarcely in the valley of the Mississippi.
The cultivator may live hardly, poorly; but he can
live, and as increasing numbers gather round him
and form a market for his superfluous produce, he
will gradually become easy, and at length wealthy.
It is however questionable whether population will
really increase very fast in an agricultural community
where a sufficient provision is made for every
family, and where there is an unlimited fund, and
power of almost indefinite extension. On the contrary,
it seems natural under these circumstances
that the proportion between the consumers and the
means of living should long continue to be an advantageous
one, and no pressure will be felt as long
as no effort is made to give a false direction to the
energies of any portion of the community.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this cannot possibly be the case in a system
which limits the amount of the estate or hýd.
Here a period must unavoidably arise where population
advances too rapidly for subsistence, unless
a manufacturing effort on an extensive scale is
made, and made with perfect freedom from all restraints,
but those which prudence and well-regulated
views of self-interest impose. If want of rapid
internal communication deprive the farmer of a
market, and compel him to limit his produce to
the requirements of his own family, there cannot
be a doubt not only that he will be compelled to
remain in a stationary and not very easy position,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>but that a difficulty will arise as to the disposal of
a redundant population. Many plans have been
devised to meet this difficulty; a favourite one has
been at all times, to endeavour to find means of
limiting population itself, instead of destroying
all restrictions upon occupation. The profoundest
thinkers of Greece, considering that a pauper population
is inconsistent with the idea of state, have
positively recommended violent means to prevent
its increase<a id='r1008' /><a href='#f1008' class='c012'><sup>[1008]</sup></a>: infanticide and exposition thus figure
among the means by which Plato and Aristotle consider
that full and perfect citizenship is to be maintained.
I have already touched upon some of the
means by which our forefathers attempted this
regulation: emigration was as popular a nostrum
with them as with us: service in the comitatus,
even servitude on the land, were looked to as an
outlet, and slavery probably served to keep up
something of a balance: moreover it is likely that
a large proportion of the population were entirely
prevented from contracting marriage: of this last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>number the various orders of the clergy, and the
monks must have made an important item. It is
even probable that the somewhat severe restrictions
imposed upon conjugal intercourse may have
had their rise in an erroneous view that population
might thus be limited or regulated<a id='r1009' /><a href='#f1009' class='c012'><sup>[1009]</sup></a>. But still, all
these means must have furnished a very inadequate
relief: even the worn-out labourer, especially
if unfree, must have become superfluous, and if he
was of little use to his owner, there was little chance
of his finding a purchaser. What provision was
made for him?</p>

<p class='c001'>The condition of a serf or an outlaw from poverty
is an abnormal one, but only so in a Christian
community. In fact it seems to me that the State
neither contemplates the existence of the poor, nor
cares for it: the poor man’s right to live is derived
from the moral and Christian, not from the public
law: so little true is the general assertion that the
poor man has a right to be maintained upon the
land on which he was born. The State exists for
its members, the full, free and independent citizens,
self-supported on the land; and except as self-supported
on the land it knows no citizens at all.
Any one but the holder of a free hýd must either
fly to the forest or take service, or steal and become
a þeóv. How the pagan Saxons contemplated this
fact it is impossible to say, but at the period when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>we first meet with them in history, two disturbing
causes were in operation; first the gradual loosening
of the principle of the mark-settlement, and the
consequent accumulation of landed estates in few
hands; secondly the operation of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c001'>This taught the equality of men in the eye of
God, who had made all men brothers in the mystery
of Christ’s passion. And from this also it followed
that those who had been bought with that precious
sacrifice were not to be cast away. The sin of
suffering a child to die unbaptized was severely
animadverted upon. The crime of infanticide could
only be expiated by years of hard and wearisome
penance; but the penance unhappily bears witness
to the principle,—a principle universally pagan,
and not given up, even to this day, by nations and
classes which would repudiate with indignation the
reproach of paganism, though thoroughly imbued
with pagan habits. In the seventh century we read
of the existence of poor, and we read also of the
duty of assisting them. But as the State had in
fact nothing to do with them, and no machinery of
its own to provide for them, and as the clergy were
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ex officio</i></span> their advocates and protectors, the State
did what under the circumstances was the best
thing to do, it recognized the duty which the clergy
had imposed upon themselves of supporting the
poor. It went further,—it compelled the freeman
to supply the clergy with the means of doing it.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the last years of the sixth century, Gregory
the Great informed Augustine that it was the custom
of the Roman church to cause a fourth part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>all that accrued to the altar from the oblations of
the faithful to be given to the poor; and this was
beyond a doubt the legitimate substitute for the old
mode of distribution which the Apostles and their
successors had adopted while the church lurked in
corners and in catacombs, and its communicants
stole a fearful and mysterious pleasure in its ministrations
under the jealous eyes of imperial paganism.
As soon however as the accidental oblations
were to a great degree replaced by settled payments
(whether arising out of land or not<a id='r1010' /><a href='#f1010' class='c012'><sup>[1010]</sup></a>), and these
were directed to be applied in definite proportions,
we may venture to say that the State had a poor-law,
and that the clergy were the relieving officers.
The spirit of Gregory’s injunction is that a part of
<em>all</em> that accrues shall be given to the poor; and
this applies with equal force to tithes, churchshots,
bóts or fines, eleemosynary grants, and casual oblations.
In this spirit, it will be seen, the Anglosaxon
clergy acted, and we may believe that no
inconsiderable fund was provided for distribution.
The liability of the tithe is the first point upon
which I shall produce evidence. The first secular
notice of this is contained in the following law of
Æðelred, an. 1014:—“And concerning tithe, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>king and his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>witan</i></span> have chosen and said, as right
it is, that the third part of the tithe which belongs
to the church, shall go to the reparation of the
church, and a second part to the servants of God,
and the third to God’s poor and needy men in
thraldom<a id='r1011' /><a href='#f1011' class='c012'><sup>[1011]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But if positive public enactment be rare, it is
not so with ecclesiastical law, and the recommendations
of the rulers of the Anglosaxon church. The
Poenitentials, Confessionals, and other works compiled
by these prelates for the guidance and instruction
of the clergy abound in passages wherein
the obligation of providing for the poor out of
the tithe is either assumed or positively asserted.
In the ‘Capitula et Fragmenta’ of Theodore, dating
in the seventh century, it is written, “It is not
lawful to give tithes save unto the poor and pilgrims<a id='r1012' /><a href='#f1012' class='c012'><sup>[1012]</sup></a>,”
which can hardly mean anything but a
prohibition to the clergy, to make friends among
the laity by giving them presents out of the tithe;
but which shows what were the lawful or legitimate
uses of tithe. Again he says<a id='r1013' /><a href='#f1013' class='c012'><sup>[1013]</sup></a>,—“If any one administers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>the xenodochia of the poor, or has received
the tithes of the people, and has converted
any portion thereof to his own uses,” etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Excerptions of archbishop Ecgberht we
find the following canon:—“The priests are to
take tithes of the people, and to make a written
list of the names of the givers, and according to
the authority of the canons, they are to divide
them, in the presence of men that fear God. The
first part they are to take for the adornment of the
church; but the second they are in all humility,
mercifully to distribute with their own hands, for
the use of the poor and strangers; the third part
however the priests may reserve for themselves<a id='r1014' /><a href='#f1014' class='c012'><sup>[1014]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Confessional of the same prelate we find
the following exhortation, to be addressed by the
priest to the penitent:—“Be thou gentle and charitable
to the poor, zealous in almsgiving, in attendance
at church, and in the giving of tithe to God’s
church and the poor<a id='r1015' /><a href='#f1015' class='c012'><sup>[1015]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the canons enacted under Eádgár, but which
are at least founded upon an ancient work of Cummianus,
there is this entry:—“We enjoin that the
priests so distribute the people’s alms, that they
do both give pleasure to God, and accustom the
people to alms<a id='r1016' /><a href='#f1016' class='c012'><sup>[1016]</sup></a>;” to which however there is an
addition which can scarcely well be understood of
anything but tithe: “and it is right that one part
be delivered to the priests, a second part for the
need of the church, and a third part for the poor.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>The Canons of Ælfríc have the same entry, and
the same mode of distribution as those of Ecgberht:
“The holy fathers have also appointed that men
shall pay their tithes into God’s church. And let
the priest go thither, and divide them into three:
one part for the repair of the church; the second
for the poor; the third for God’s servants who
attend to the church<a id='r1017' /><a href='#f1017' class='c012'><sup>[1017]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus according to the view of the Anglosaxon
church, ratified by the express enactment of the
witan, a third of the tithe was the absolute property
of the poor. But other means were found to
increase this fund: not only was the duty of almsgiving
strenuously enforced, but even the fasts and
penances recommended or imposed by the clergy
were made subservient to the same charitable purpose.
The canons enacted under Eádgár provide<a id='r1018' /><a href='#f1018' class='c012'><sup>[1018]</sup></a>,
that “when a man fasts, then let the dishes that
would have been eaten be all distributed to God’s
poor.” And again the Ecclesiastical Institutes declare<a id='r1019' /><a href='#f1019' class='c012'><sup>[1019]</sup></a>:
“It is daily needful for every man that he
give his alms to poor men; but yet when we fast,
then ought we to give greater alms than on other
days; because the meat and the drink, which we
should then use if we did not fast, we ought to
distribute to the poor.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So in certain cases where circumstances rendered
the strict performance of penance difficult
or impossible, a kind of tariff seems to have been
devised, the application of which was left to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>discretion of the confessor. The proceeds of this
commutation were for the benefit of the poor. Thus
Theodore teaches<a id='r1020' /><a href='#f1020' class='c012'><sup>[1020]</sup></a>:—“But let him that through infirmity
cannot fast, give alms to the poor according
to his means; that is, for every day a penny
or two or three.... For a year let him give thirty
shillings in alms; the second year, twenty; the
third, fifteen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Again<a id='r1021' /><a href='#f1021' class='c012'><sup>[1021]</sup></a>:—“He that knows not the psalms and
cannot fast, must give twenty-two shillings in alms
for the poor, as commutation for a year’s fasting
on bread and water; and let him fast every Friday
on bread and water, and three forties; that is,
forty days before Easter, forty before the festival
of St. John the Baptist, and forty before Christmas-day.
And in these three forties let him estimate
the value or possible value of whatsoever is
prepared for his use, in food, in drink or whatever
it may be, and let him distribute the half of
that value in alms to the poor,” etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we consider the almost innumerable cases
in which penance must have been submitted to by
conscientious believers, and the frequent hindrances
which public or private business and illness must
have thrown in the way of strict performance, we
may conclude that no slight addition accrued from
this source to the fund at the disposal of the church
for the benefit of the poor. Even the follies and
vices of men were made to contribute their quota
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>in a more direct form. Ecgberht requires that a
portion of the spoil gained in war shall be applied
to charitable purposes<a id='r1022' /><a href='#f1022' class='c012'><sup>[1022]</sup></a>; and he estimates the
amount at no less than a third of the whole booty.
Again, it is positively enacted by Æðelred and his
witan that a portion of the fines paid by offenders
to the church should be applied in a similar manner:
they say<a id='r1023' /><a href='#f1023' class='c012'><sup>[1023]</sup></a>, that such money “belongs lawfully,
by the direction of the bishops, to the buying
of prayers, to the behoof of the poor, to the reparation
of churches, to the instruction, clothing and
feeding of those who minister to God, for books,
bells and vestments, but never for idle pomp of
this world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>More questionable is a command inculcated by
archbishop Ecgberht, that the over-wealthy should
punish themselves for their folly by large contributions
to the poor<a id='r1024' /><a href='#f1024' class='c012'><sup>[1024]</sup></a>: “Let him that collecteth
immoderate wealth, for his want of wisdom, give
the third part to the poor.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon the bishops and clergy was especially imposed
the duty of attending to this branch of
Christian charity, which they were commanded to
exemplify in their own persons: thus the bishops
are admonished to feed and clothe the poor<a id='r1025' /><a href='#f1025' class='c012'><sup>[1025]</sup></a>, the
clerk who possessed a superfluity was to be excommunicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>if he did not distribute it to the poor<a id='r1026' /><a href='#f1026' class='c012'><sup>[1026]</sup></a>,
nay the clergy were admonished to learn and practise
handicrafts, not only in order to keep themselves
out of mischief and avoid the temptations of
idleness, but that they might earn funds wherewith
to relieve the necessities of their brethren<a id='r1027' /><a href='#f1027' class='c012'><sup>[1027]</sup></a>. Those
who are acquainted with the MSS. and other remains
of Anglosaxon art are well-aware how great
eminence was attained by some of these clerical
workmen, and how valuable their skill may have
been in the eyes of the wealthy and liberal<a id='r1028' /><a href='#f1028' class='c012'><sup>[1028]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another source of relief remains to be noticed:
I mean the eleemosynary foundations. It is of
course well known that every church and monastery
comprised among its necessary buildings a
xenodochium, hospitium or similar establishment,
a kind of hospital for the reception and refection of
the poor, the houseless and the wayfarer. But I
allude more particularly to the foundations which
the piety of the clergy or laics established without
the walls of the churches or monasteries. Æðelstán
commanded the royal reeves throughout his
realm to feed and clothe one poor man each: the
allowance was to be, from every two farms, an
amber of meal, a shank of bacon, or a ram worth
fourpence, monthly, and clothing for the whole
year. The reeves here intended must have been
the bailiffs (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">villici</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">praepositi</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">túngeréfan</span>) of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>royal vills; and, if they could not find a poor man
in their vill, they were to seek him in another<a id='r1029' /><a href='#f1029' class='c012'><sup>[1029]</sup></a>.
In the churches which were especially favoured
with the patronage of the wealthy and powerful, it
was usual for the anniversary of the patron to be
celebrated with religious services, a feast to the brotherhood
and a distribution of food to the poor,
which was occasionally a very liberal one. In the
year 832 we learn incidentally what were the charitable
foundations of archbishop Wulfred. He
commanded twenty-six poor men to be daily fed on
different manors, he gave each of them yearly
twenty-six pence to purchase clothing, and further
ordered that on his anniversary twelve hundred
poor men should receive each a loaf of bread and a
cheese, or bacon and one penny<a id='r1030' /><a href='#f1030' class='c012'><sup>[1030]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oswulf, who was duke of East Kent at the commencement
of the ninth century, left lands to Canterbury
charging the canons with doles upon his
anniversary: twenty ploughlands or about twelve
hundred acres at Stanstead were to supply the
canons and the poor on that day with one hundred
and twenty wheaten loaves, thirty of pure wheat,
one fat ox, four sheep, two flitches, five geese, ten
hens, ten pounds of cheese (or if it happened to be
a fastday, a weigh of cheese, fish, butter and eggs
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad libitum</i></span>), thirty measures of good Welsh ale, and
a tub of honey or two of wine. From the lands of
the brotherhood were to issue one hundred and
twenty <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>sufl</i></span> loaves, apparently a kind of cake; while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>his lands at Bourn were to supply a thousand loaves
of bread and a thousand <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>sufls</i></span><a id='r1031' /><a href='#f1031' class='c012'><sup>[1031]</sup></a>. Towards the end
of the tenth century Wulfwaru devised her lands
to various relatives, and charged them with the support
of twenty poor men<a id='r1032' /><a href='#f1032' class='c012'><sup>[1032]</sup></a>. About the same period
Æðelstán the æðeling gave lands to Ely on condition
that they fed one hundred poor men on his
anniversary, at the expense of his heirs.</p>

<p class='c001'>From what has preceded it may fairly be argued
that at all times there was a very sufficient fund
for the relief of the poor, seeing that tithe, penance,
fine, voluntary contribution, and compulsory assessment
all combined to furnish their quota. It now
remains to enquire into the method of its distribution.</p>

<p class='c001'>The gains of the altar, whether in tithes, oblations,
or other forms, were strictly payable over to
the metropolitan or cathedral church of the district.
The division of the fund was thus committed to the
consulting body of the clergy, and their executive
or head; and the several shares were thus distributed
under the supervision and by the authority
of the bishop and his canons in each diocese. Private
alms may have remained occasionally at the
disposal of the priest in a small parish, but the recognized
public alms which were the property of
the poor, and held in trust for them by the clergy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>were necessarily managed by the principal body,
the clergy of the cathedral. To the vicinity of the
cathedral flocked the maimed, the halt, the blind,
the destitute and friendless, to be fed and clothed
and tended for the love of God. In that vicinity
they enjoyed shelter, defence, private aid and public
alms; and as in some few cases the cathedral
church was surrounded by a flourishing city, they
could hope for the chances which always accompany
a close manufacturing or retailing population.
In this way the largest proportion of the poor must
have been collected near the chief church of the
diocese, on whose lands they found an easy settlement,
in whose xenodochia, hospitals and almshouses
they met with a refuge, to whom they gave
their services, such as they were, and from whom
they received in turn the support which secular
lords were unable or unwilling to give: for the
cathedral church being generally a very considerable
landowner, had the power of employing much
more labour than the majority of secular landlords
in any given district.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it must not be imagined that the poor could
obtain no relief save at the cathedral: every parish-church
had its share of the public fund, as well as
private alms, devoted to this purpose; and to the
necessary buildings of every parish-church, however
small, a xenodochium belonged. When now
we consider the great number of churches that
existed all over England in the tenth century, a
number which most likely exceeded that now in
being, and consequently bore a most disproportionate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>ratio to the then population of the country,—when
we further consider that the poor were comparatively
few (so that a provision was absolutely
made for the case where a pauper could not be
found in a royal village), we shall have no difficulty
in concluding that relief was supplied in a very
ample degree to the needy.</p>

<p class='c001'>It does not necessarily follow, although in itself
very probable, that the claim to relief was a territorial
one, that is that the man was to have relief
where he was born, lived or had gained a settlement
by labour. As some landowners, particularly in
later times, especially honoured certain churches
with the grant of tithes consecrated to them, it is
possible that some paupers may have followed the
convenient precedent, and argued that whither the
fund went, thither might the recipients go also.
And inasmuch as in many cases they would appear
under the guise of poor pilgrims, we can readily
understand the immense resort to particular shrines
at particular periods, without overrating the devotion
or the superstition of the multitude. But all
this might have led to very serious consequences,
had the facilities <em>really</em> been so great. In point of
fact there were no facilities at all except for such
as were from age or infirmity incapable of doing
any valuable service. For among the Saxons the
law of settlement applied inexorably to all classes:
no man had a legal existence unless he could be
shown to belong to some association connected
with a certain locality, or to be in the hand, protection
and surety of a landed lord. Even a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>man of the rank nearest the princes or ealdorman
could not leave his land without having fulfilled
certain conditions; and the illegal migration of a
dependent man from one shire or one estate to
another was punished in the severest manner, in
the persons of all concerned. He was called a
Flýma or fugitive, and the receiving or harbouring
him was a grave offence, punishable with a
heavy fine, to be raised for the benefit of the king’s
officers in the shire the fugitive deserted, as well as
that wherein he was received<a id='r1033' /><a href='#f1033' class='c012'><sup>[1033]</sup></a>. Even if the vigilance
of the sheriffs and ealdorman in two shires
could be lulled, it was difficult to disarm the selfishness
of a landlord or an owner who thought
the runaway’s services of any value, or his price
worth securing. A year and a day must elapse ere
the right abated from the “lord in pursuit,” for so
was the lord called over all Europe in the idioms
of the several tongues<a id='r1034' /><a href='#f1034' class='c012'><sup>[1034]</sup></a>; and hence it cannot have
been a very easy matter for any man to take advantage
of the poor-law, while it remained any one’s
advantage to keep him from falling into the state
of pauperism: in other words, no man whose labour
still possessed any value would be so cast upon the
world as to have no refuge but what the church in
Christian charity provided. And this was the real
and trustworthy test of destitution. If a man was
so helpless, friendless and useless that he could
find no place in one of the mutual associations, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>in a lord’s family, it is clear that he must become
an outlaw as far as the State is concerned<a id='r1035' /><a href='#f1035' class='c012'><sup>[1035]</sup></a>: he
must fly to the woods, turn serf or steal, or else
commend himself as a pauper to the benefits of
clerical superintendence: but it is perfectly obvious
that none but the hopelessly infirm or aged could
ever be placed under such difficulty, in a country
situated like England at any period of the Saxon
rule, and hence pauper relief was in practice strictly
confined to those for whom it was justly intended.
The Saxon poor-law then appears simple enough,
and well might it be so: they had not tried many
unsuccessful and ridiculous experiments in &oelig;conomics,
suffered themselves to be misled by very
many mischievous crochets, nor on the whole did
they find it necessary to make so expensive a
protest against bad commercial legislation as our
poor-law has proved to us. But it is not quite the
simple thing it seems, and requires two elements
for its efficient working, which are not to be found
at every period, namely a powerful, conscientious
clergy, and a system of property founded exclusively
upon the possession of land, and guarded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>a compulsory distribution of all citizens into certain
fixed and settled associations.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have already called attention to the fact that it
was usual, if not necessary, on emancipating a serf,
to provide for his subsistence. It is however not
improbable that, though such emancipated serfs
remained for the most part upon the land, and in
the protection of their former lord, they found some
assistance from the poor fund, either directly from
the church, or indirectly through the private alms
of the lord.</p>

<p class='c001'>To resume all the facts of the case:—the State
did not contemplate the existence or provide for
the support of any poor: it demanded that every
man should either be answerable for himself in a
mutual bond of association with his neighbours; or
that he should place himself under the protection
of a lord, if he had no means of his own, and thus
have some one to answer for him. If unfree, the
State of course held him to be the chattel of his
owner, who was only responsible to God for his
treatment of him. He therefore who had no means
and could find no one to take charge of him was
an outlaw, that is, had no civil rights of any kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Christianity taught that there was something
even above the State, which the State itself was
bound to recognize. It accordingly impressed upon
all communicants the moral and religious duty of
assisting those of their brethren whom the strict
law condemned to misery; and the clergy presented
their organization as a very efficient machinery for
the proper distribution of alms. The voluntary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>oblations became in time replaced by settled payments;
but the law did not alter the disposition
which the clergy had adopted; it only recognized
and sanctioned it; first by making the various
church payments compulsory upon all classes; and
secondly by enacting that the mode of distribution
long prevalent should be the legal one, in a secular
as well as an ecclesiastical obligation. And thus
by slow degrees, as the State itself became Christianized,
the moral duty became a legal one; and
the merciful intervention of religion was allowed to
supply what could not be found in the strict rule
of law.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is unnecessary here to enquire how the power
of the clergy to assist the poor was gradually diminished,
by the arbitrary consecration or total subtraction
of tithe, and other ecclesiastical payments;
or how the burthen of supporting the poor, having
become a religious as well as a civil duty, was
shifted from one fund to another. It is enough to
have shown how the difficulty was attempted to be
met during the continuance of the Anglosaxon institutions.
Under the present circumstances of
almost every European state, it is admitted that no
man is to perish for want of means, while means
anywhere exist to feed him: and but two questions
can be admitted, namely:—Who is really in
want? and,—How is he to be fed at the least possible
amount of loss to others? This is as far as the
State will go. Religion, properly considered, imposes
very different duties, and very different tests:
but public morality alone ought to teach that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>where the State has interfered on one side, it must
pay the penalty on the other; and that where it
has positively prescribed the directions in which
men shall seek their subsistence, it is bound to
indemnify those whom these restrictions have
tended to impoverish. Every Poor Law is a protest
against some wrong done: and in proportion
to the wrong is the energy of the protest itself.
Do not interfere with industry, and it will be very
safe to leave poverty to take care of itself. It is
quite possible to conceive a state of things in
which crime and poverty shall be really convertible
ideas, but of this the history of the world as
yet has given us no example.</p>

aught of this neglect which stands in our writings, and we with
our ‘<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">weds</span>’ have confirmed.</p>

know when he has his cattle, or when he has not, on his neighbour’s
witness, and that he point out to us the track, if he cannot
find it within three days; for we believe that many heedless men
reck not how their cattle go, for over-confidence in the ‘<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">frith.</span>’</p>

search nevertheless go on as it was before ordained, for we will not
pay for any unguarded property, unless it be stolen. Many men
speak fraudulent speech. If he cannot point out to us the track,
let him show on oath with <span class='fss'>III</span> of his neighbours that it has been
stolen within <span class='fss'>III</span> days, and after that let him ask for his ‘<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ceap-gild.</span>’</p>

<p class='c001'>“9. And let it not be denied nor concealed, if our lord or any
of our reeves should suggest to us any addition to our ‘<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">frith-gilds</span>’
that we will joyfully accept the same, as it becomes us all, and
may be advantageous to us. But let us trust in God, and our
kingly lord, if we fulfil all things thus, that the affairs of all folk
will be better with respect to theft than they before were. If,

given, and the king has commanded of us, then may we expect,
or well know, that these thieves will prevail yet more than they
did before. But let us keep our ‘<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">weds</span>’ and the ‘<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">frith</span>’ as is

been said, to illustrate the line of argument adopted in the text.
There is no single point in all mediæval history of more importance
than the manner in which the towns assumed their municipal
form; and none in which the gradual progress of the popular
liberties can be more securely traced. But all these compromises
imply a long apprenticeship to freedom before the “master’s”
dignity was attained: and great is the debt of gratitude we owe
to those whose sufferings and labour have enabled us to understand
and to record their struggles.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>
  <h4 class='c033'>APPENDIX B. <br /> TITHE.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The importance of this subject requires a full statement of details:
the following are all the passages in the Anglosaxon law which
have reference to this impost.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I Æðelstán the king, with the counsel of Wulfhelm, archbishop,
and of my other bishops, make known to the reeves in
each town, and beseech you, in God’s name, and by all his saints,
and also by my friendship, that ye first of my own goods render the
tithes both of live stock and of the year’s increase, even as they
may most justly be either measured or counted or weighed out;
and let the bishops then do the like from their own property, and
my ealdormen and reeves the same. And I will, that the bishop
and the reeves command it to all who are bound to obey them, so
that it be done at the right term. Let us bear in mind how Jacob
the Patriarch spoke: ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Decimas et hostias pacificas offeram tibi;</span>’
and how Moses spake in God’s law: ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Decimas et primitias non
tardabis offerre Domino.</span>’ It is for us to reflect how awfully it is
declared in the books: if we will not render the tithes to God,
that he will take from us the nine parts when we least expect;
and, moreover, we have the sin in addition thereto.” Æðelst. i.
Thorpe, i. 195.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a varying copy of this circular, or whatever it is, coinciding
as to the matter, but differing widely in the words. Thorpe,
i. 195. The nature of the sanction is obvious: it is the old, unjustifiable
application of the Jewish practice, which fraud or ignorance
had made generally current in Europe. The tithe mentioned
by Æðelstán is the prædial tithe, or that of increase of the fruits
of the earth, and increase of the young of cattle.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>The next passage is in the law of Eádmund, about 940. He
says: “Tithe we enjoin to every Christian man on his christendom,
and church-shot, and Rome-fee and plough-alms. And if
any one will not do it, be he excommunicate.” Thorpe, i. 244.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let every tithe be paid to the old minster to which the district
belongs; and let it be so paid both from a thane’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>inland</i></span> and from
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>geneátland</i></span>, as the plough traverses it. But if there be any thane
who on his bookland has a church, at which there is a burial-place,
let him give the third part of his own tithe to his church.
If any one have a church at which there is not a burial-place,
then of the nine parts let him give his priest what he will....
And let tithe of every young be paid by Pentecost, and of the
fruits of the earth by the equinox ... and if any one will not

<p class='c001'>“This writing manifests how Eádgár the king was deliberating
what might be a remedy for the pestilence which greatly afflicted
and decreased his people, far and wide throughout his realm.
And first of all it seemed to him and his Witan that such a misfortune
had been merited by sin, and by contempt of God’s commandments,
and most of all by the diminution of that <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>need-gafol</i></span>
(necessary tax or rent or recognitory service) which men ought to
render to God in their tithes. He looked upon and considered
the divine usage in the same light as the human. If a geneát
neglect his lord’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gafol</i></span>, and do not pay it at the appointed time,
it may be expected, if the lord be merciful, that he will grant
forgiveness of the neglect, and accept the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gafol</i></span> without inflicting
a further penalty. But if the lord, by his messengers, frequently
remind him of his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gafol</i></span>, and he be obdurate and devise to resist
payment, it is to be expected that the lord’s anger will so greatly
increase, that he will grant his debtor neither life nor goods. Thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>is it to be expected that our Lord will do, through the audacity
with which the people have resisted the frequent admonition of
their teachers, respecting the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>need-gafol</i></span> of our Lord, namely our
tithes and church-shots. Now I and the archbishop command
that ye anger not God, nor earn either sudden death in this world,
nor a future and eternal death in hell, by any diminution of God’s
rights; but that rich and poor alike, who have any tilth, joyfully
and ungrudgingly yield his tithes to God, according to the ordinance
of the witan at Andover, which they have now confirmed
with their pledges at Wihtbordesstán. And I command my reeves,
on pain of losing my friendship and all they own, to punish all that
will not make this payment, or by any remissness break the pledge
of my witan, as the aforesaid ordinance directs: and of such punishment
let there be no remission, if he be so wretched as either
to diminish what is God’s to his own soul’s perdition, or in the
insolence of his mood to account them of less importance than
what he reckoneth as his own: for that is much more his own
which lasteth to all eternity, if he would do it without grudging and
with perfect gladness. Now it is my will that these divine rights
stand alike all over my realm, and that the servants of God who
receive the moneys which we give to God, live a pure life: that so,
through their purity, they may intercede for us with God; and
that I and my thanes direct our priests to that which the shepherds
of our soul’s teach us, that is, our bishops, whom we ought
never to disobey in any of those things which they declare to us
in God’s behalf; so that through the obedience with which we
obey them for God’s sake, we may merit that eternal life for which
they fit us by their doctrine and the example of their good works.”

</div>

<p class='c015'>The strict meaning of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>burh</i></span>, appears to be <em>fortified place</em> or
<em>stronghold</em>. It can therefore be applied to a single house or
castle, as well as to a town. There is a softer form <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>byrig</i></span>, which
in the sense of a town can hardly be distinguished from <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>burh</i></span>,
but which, as far as I know, is never used to denote a single house
or castle. Rome and Florence, and in general all large towns, are
called Burh or Byrig. This is the widest term.</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Port</i></span> strictly means an enclosed place, for sale and purchase, a
market: for “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Portus est conclusus locus, quo importantur merces,
et inde exportantur. Est et statio conclusa et munita.</span>” (Thorpe, i.
p. 158.)</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wíc</i></span> is originally <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vicus</i></span>, a vill or village. It is strictly used to
denote the country-houses of communities, kings or bishops.</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Ceaster</i></span> seems universally derived from <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>castrum</i></span>, and denotes a
place where there has been a Roman station. Now every one of
these conditions may concur in one single place, and we accordingly
find much looseness in the use of the terms: thus,</p>

<p class='c001'>London is called Lundenwíc<a id='r1037' /><a href='#f1037' class='c012'><sup>[1037]</sup></a>, Hhoðh. § 16. Chron. 604: but

994, 1009, 1013, 1016, 1052. And it was also a port, for we
find its <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span>, a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">port-geréfa</span>. Again York, sometimes Eoferwíc,
sometimes Eoferwíc-ceaster (Chron. 971) is also said to be a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burh</span>,
Chron. 1066. Dovor is called a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burh</span>, Chron. 1048; but a port,
Chron. 1052. So again Hereford, in Chron. 1055, 1056, is called a
port, but in Chron. 1055 also a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burh</span>. Nor do the Latin chroniclers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>help us out of the difficulty; on the contrary, they continually
use the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>oppidum</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>civitas</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>urbs</i></span> and even <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>arx</i></span> to denote

It seems to have been always a considerable and important
town. In the tenth century it was one of the seven confederated
burgs, which Æðelflǽd reduced. The strength however which we
should be inclined to look for in a city, which once boasted the
name of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>altera Roma</i></span>, is hardly consistent with Asser’s account of
it. Describing the place in the year 867, he says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Praedictus
Paganorum exercitus ... ad Eboracum ciuitatem migravit, quae
in aquilonari ripa Humbrensis fluminis<a id='r1038' /><a href='#f1038' class='c012'><sup>[1038]</sup></a> sita est.</span>” After stating
that Ælla and Osberht, the pretenders to the Northumbrian crown,
became reconciled in presence of the common danger, he continues:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Osbyrht et Ælla, adunatis viribus, congregatoque exercitu Eboracum
oppidum adeunt, quibus advenientibus Pagani confestim
fugam arripiunt, et intra urbis moenia se defendere procurant:
quorum fugam et pavorem Christiani cernentes, etiam intra urbis
moenia persequi, et murum frangere instituunt: quod et fecerunt,
non enim tunc adhuc illa civitas firmos et stabilitos muros illis
temporibus habebat. Cumque Christiani murum, ut proposuerant,
fregissent, etc.</span><a id='r1039' /><a href='#f1039' class='c012'><sup>[1039]</sup></a>” We may infer from Asser himself that
the Saxon mode of fortification. was not strong: speaking of
a place in Devonshire, called Cynuit (which he describes as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>arx</i></span>),
he says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum Pagani arcem imparatam atque omnino immunitam,
nisi quod moenia nostro more erecta solummodo haberet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>cernerent, non enim effringere moliebantur, quia et ille locus situ
terrarum tutissimus est ab omni parte, nisi ab orientali, sicut nos
ipsi vidimus, obsidere eam coeperunt</span><a id='r1040' /><a href='#f1040' class='c012'><sup>[1040]</sup></a>.” York however continued
to be an important town. It was retaken by Æðelflǽd who subdued
the Danes there; and again by Eádred in 950. At this
time it appears to have been principally ruled by its archbishop
Wulfstán. For York, see Chron. 971, 1066, etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>Exanceaster, now Exeter, the Isca Damnoniorum or Uxella, of
the Romans. Chron. 876, 894, 1003. As the Saxon arms advanced
westward, Exeter became for a time the frontier town and
market between the British and the men of Wessex: in the beginning
of the tenth century there appears to have been a mixed
population. But at that period<a id='r1041' /><a href='#f1041' class='c012'><sup>[1041]</sup></a> Æðelstán expelled the British
inhabitants, and fortified the town: he drove the Cornwealhas
over the Tamar, and made that their boundary, as he had the Wye
for the Bretwealas. William of Malmesbury tells us: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Illos (i. e.
Cornewalenses) impigre adorsus, ab Excestra, quam ad id temporis
aequo cum Anglis iure inhabitarunt, cedere compulit: terminum
provinciae suae citra Tambram fluvium constituens, sicut aquilonalibus
Britannis amnem Waiam limitem posuerat. Urbem igitur
illam, quam contaminatae gentis repurgio defaecaverat, turribus
munivit, muro ex quadratis lapidibus cinxit<a id='r1042' /><a href='#f1042' class='c012'><sup>[1042]</sup></a>. Et licet solum illud,
ieiunum et squalidum, vix steriles avenas, et plerumque folliculum
inanem sine grano producat, tamen pro civitatis magnificentia, et incolarum
opulentia, tum etiam convenarum frequentia, omne ibi adeo
abundat mercimonium, ut nihil frustra desideres quod humano usui
conducibile existimes<a id='r1043' /><a href='#f1043' class='c012'><sup>[1043]</sup></a>.</span>” Thus situated, about ten miles from the
sea, Exanceaster could not fail to become an important commercial
station; the Exa being navigable for ships of considerable burthen,
till in 1284, Hugh Courtenay interrupted the traffic, by building a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>weir and quay at Topsham. It is probable that Æðelstán placed
his own <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geréfa</span> in the city. But in the year 1003, queen Emme
Ælfgyfu seems to have been its lady; for it is recorded that through
the treachery of a Frenchman Hugo, whom she had made her
reeve there, the Danes under Svein sacked and destroyed the
city, taking great plunder<a id='r1044' /><a href='#f1044' class='c012'><sup>[1044]</sup></a>. It was afterwards restored by Cnut;
but appears to have been still attached to the queens of England,

Gýð, the mother of Harald.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>I do not think it necessary to repeat here the arguments which I
have used elsewhere<a id='r1045' /><a href='#f1045' class='c012'><sup>[1045]</sup></a>, to show that Cyricsceat has nothing whatever
to do with our modern church-rates, or that these arose from
papal usurpation very long after the Norman Conquest. I can
indeed only express my surprise that any churchman should still
be found willing to continue a system which exposes the dignity
and peace of the church to be disturbed by any schismatic who
may see in agitation a cheap step to popularity. But as the
question has been put in that light, it may be convenient for the
sake of reference to collect the principal passages in the laws and
charters which refer to the impost. They are the following:—</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>The only instance that I can find of this impost being noticed
in the Ecclesiastical Laws, or Recommendations of the Bishops
and Clergy, is in the Canons attributed to Eádgár:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“And we enjoin, that the priests remind the people of what
they ought to do to God for dues, in tithes and in other things;
first plough-alms, xv days after Easter; and tithe of young, by
Pentecost; and of fruits of the earth, by All Saints; and Róm-feoh
(Peter-pence) by St. Peter’s Mass; and Cyricsceat by Martinmass<a id='r1046' /><a href='#f1046' class='c012'><sup>[1046]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunc igitur praecipio et obtestor omnes meos episcopos et

<p class='c001'>Oswald’s grants often contain this clause: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sit autem terra ista
libera omni regi nisi aecclesiastici censi.</span>” See Codex Dipl. Nos.
494, 498, 515, 540, 552, 558, 649, 680, 681, 682. But sometimes
the amount is more closely defined: thus in No. 498, two
bushels of wheat. In No. 511 we have this strong expression:
“Free from all <em>worldly service</em> (<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">weoruldcund þeówet</span>), except three
things, one is cyricsceat, and that he (work) with all his might,
twice in the year, once at mowing, once at reaping.” And in
No. 625 he repeats this, making the land granted free, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab omni
<em>mundialium</em> servitute tributorum, exceptis sanctae Dei aecclesiae
necessitatibus atque utilitatibus.</span>” Again, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et semper possessor
terrae illius reddat tributum aecclesiasticum, quod ciricsceat dicitur,
tó Pirigtúne; et omni anno unus ager inde aretur tó Pirigtúne,

of finding the cyricsceat to the lord’s barn, but whether because
the lord was an ecclesiastic does not clearly appear.</p>

<p class='c001'>The important provisions of Denewulf’s and Ealhfrið’s charters
have been sufficiently illustrated in the text.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the conquest, Chirset or Chircettum, as it is called, was
very irregularly levied: it appears to have been granted occasionally
by the lords to the church, but no longer to have been a
general impost: and nothing is more common than to find it considered
as a set-off against other forms of rent-paying, on lay as
well as ecclesiastical land. If the tenant gave <em>work</em>, he usually
paid no chircet: if he paid chircet, his amount of labour-rent was
diminished: a strong evidence, if any more were wanted, that
cyricsceat has nothing whatever to do with church-rate.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
